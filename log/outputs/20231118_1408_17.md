## Introduction to Passive Diathesis and Voice in Psycholinguistics

- Understanding passive constructions
  - Passive diathesis maps thematic patient roles to syntactic subjects
  - Passive voice is marked on verbs to indicate passive diathesis
- Japanese passive constructions
  - V-*te morau* and V-(*r*)*are* as analytical and synthetical markers
  - Distinction from other non-passive uses of the same forms
- Cognitive load in processing passives
  - Comparison with European SVO languages
  - Previous Japanese studies lacked direct cross-linguistic comparisons

## The Experiment: V-*te morau* vs. V-*te ageru*

- Self-paced reading (SPR) task
  - Participants read sentences chunk by chunk
  - Focus on benefactive constructions
- Comprehension question task
  - Utilized normal active V-$\emptyset$ and V-(*r*)*are* passive
- Results and implications
  - No significant difference in reading times
  - Enhanced accuracy with V-(*r*)*are* passive questions

## Defining Passive in Japanese: V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau*

- Passive diathesis and voice
  - Thematic roles and grammatical relations
  - Passive voice indicated by verb markers
- Analytical vs. synthetical marking
  - V-*te morau* as an analytical passive construction
  - V-(*r*)*are* as a synthetical passive marker

## Japanese Passive Voices: V-(*r*)*are*

- Morphology of V-(*r*)*are*
  - Marks passive voice synthetically
  - Patient expressed by nominative subject
- Agent demotion
  - From core argument to dative-marked oblique
- Active vs. passive comparison
  - Contrast with nominative-marked subject in active voice

- Structure of V-*te morau*
  - Analytical passive construction
  - Main verb in non-finite form with converb *-te*
- Benefactive passive
  - Auxiliary verb *morau* indicates reception
  - Comparison with periphrastic passives
- Active counterpart
  - V-*te ageru* with auxiliary verb *ageru*

## Differences Between V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau*

- Patient and beneficiary roles
  - Similarities in semantic roles and grammatical functions
  - Subject assigned to patient NP in both constructions
- Distinctive features of V-*te morau*
  - Implies benefit to the patient from the agent
  - Suggests a debt of gratitude from the patient to the agent
- Typological distinction
  - Beneficiary often coded differently from patient
  - Direct vs. indirect effects of the event on the beneficiary

## Processing Difficulty in Passives

- Review of experimental results
  - English, German, and Japanese language studies
  - Reading times and comprehension accuracy as measures
- Japanese V-(*r*)*are* passive
  - Suggests processing difficulty in previous studies
  - Lack of reading time measurement in Japanese research

## Rationale for Comparing V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*

- Justification for construction selection
  - Control for morphological complexity
  - Comparison with V-(*r*)*are* passive and V-$\emptyset$ active
- Methodological considerations
  - Self-paced reading task design
  - Comprehension question task alignment

## Methodology and Results of the SPR Experiment

- Experimental design
  - Sentence reading and comprehension question tasks
- Benefactive constructions
  - V-*te morau* passive and V-*te ageru* active
- Findings
  - Reading time parity between passive and active
  - Comprehension accuracy influenced by question form

## Discussion and Implications

- Primability of patient-like beneficiaries
  - Enhanced comprehension with passive questions
- Broad patientive macrorole
  - Implications for psycholinguistic models of sentence processing
- Future research directions
  - Cross-linguistic comparisons and further exploration of passive complexity
