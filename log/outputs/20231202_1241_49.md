## Data Exclusion Criteria

- Removed data for participants with multiple entries or suspected of such.
- Excluded data with improper stimulus presentation or server recording errors.
- Applied accuracy threshold for distractor responses, following [@Paolazzi_etal2019].
- Reading times below 50 ms were excluded to ensure data integrity.

## Statistical Models Overview

- Employed Bayesian generalised mixed effect models using `R` [@R-base].
- Built models with `brms` package [@R-brms].
- Calculated coefficients with `cmdstanr` and Bayes factors with `rstan` [@R-cmdstanr; @R-rstan; @R-bridgesampling].
- Models fitted with specific parameters for robustness and reliability.

## Bayes Factors and Evidence

- Bayes factors ($\text{BF}_{10}$) compared alternative and null models.
- Assessed the strength of evidence for each model.
- Used Lee and Wagenmakers' criteria to interpret Bayes factors [@BCM2013].

## Prior Settings and Predictive Checks

- Priors significantly influence Bayes factor calculations.
- Conducted prior predictive checks for calibration [@Schad_etal2020; @Schad_etal2022].
- Systematically varied prior SDs to observe changes in coefficient values and $\text{BF}_{10}$ [@Nicenboim_etal2020].

## Reading Time Data Analysis

- Reading time assumed to be log-normally distributed.
- Voice of target sum-coded for analysis.
- Included covariates such as region length and trial order, both $z$-transformed.
- Priors for target voice determined through prior predictive checks [@PL-BDA2021].

## Accuracy of Comprehension Questions

- Analyzed accuracy data using mixed effects logistic regressions.
- Sum-coded voice of target and NP order in comprehension questions.
- Employed nested sum contrast coding for voice (mis)match effect [@Schad_etal2020_contrasts].
- Priors for target voice and other parameters set based on predictive checks.
