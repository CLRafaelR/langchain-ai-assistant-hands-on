## Introduction to Japanese Passives

- Japanese passives can be more cognitively demanding than actives.
  - Studies suggest increased processing load for passives [@Tamaoka_etal2005; @Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017].
- Distinction between V-*te morau* benefactive passive and V-*te ageru* benefactive active.
  - Both constructions analytically express voice, differing from V-(*r*)*are* passive and V-$\emptyset$ active.
- Importance of understanding the cognitive processing of passive constructions.
  - Insights into language comprehension and the patientive macrorole.

## Defining Passive Diathesis and Voice in Japanese

- Diathesis refers to thematic role assignments to grammatical relations.
- Voice indicates verbal marking representing a diathesis [@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book].
- Japanese has synthetic and analytical passive markers.
  - V-*te morau* is an analytical passive construction.
- Distinction between passive voice and other constructions using similar forms.
  - Focus on V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau* in passive diathesis.

## Processing Difficulty in Passives

- European languages show less or equal cognitive load for passives compared to actives [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019].
- Japanese studies indicate increased difficulty in processing passives [@Tamaoka_etal2005; @Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017].
  - Need for direct comparisons and refined tasks to measure specific cognitive loads.

## Experiment Rationale

- Aim to identify challenging parts in Japanese passives for comprehension.
- Compare V-*te morau* passive with V-*te ageru* active to control morphological complexity.
- Investigate the effect of voice mismatch between target stimuli and comprehension questions.

## Experiment Methodology

- Conducted a self-paced reading (SPR) task followed by comprehension questions.
- Participants: 262 native Japanese speakers, with exclusions based on language history.
- Stimuli: Manipulated voice (active vs. passive) using V-*te ageru* and V-*te morau*.
- Procedure: Trials consisted of SPR and comprehension question tasks, with practice sessions.

## Results and Interpretation

- Reading times for V-*te morau* passives were longer than V-*te ageru* actives.
  - Contrasts with previous findings in English and German.
- Accuracy in comprehension questions was lower for passives.
  - Indicates greater difficulty in comprehending passives.
- Voice mismatch between target and question affected accuracy.
  - Suggests a broad patientive macrorole in cognitive processing.

## Conclusion

- Japanese benefactive passives (V-*te morau*) are more challenging to comprehend than their active counterparts (V-*te ageru*).
- The study highlights the importance of considering morphological and syntactic factors in language processing.
- Future research should explore cross-linguistic validation and further investigate the patientive macrorole.
