## Understanding Japanese Passives

- Exploring the cognitive load of passive constructions
  - Comparison with European SVO languages
  - Unique challenges in Japanese passive comprehension

## Passive Diathesis and Voice

- Defining diathesis and voice in linguistics
  - Diathesis: Assignment of thematic roles
  - Voice: Verbal marking representing diathesis
- Japanese passives: V-*te morau* and V-(*r*)*are*
  - Analytical vs. synthetic passive markers

## Japanese Passive Constructions

- V-(*r*)*are* passives: Synthetically marked
  - Example: Mochizuki=ga Kamimura=ni home-*rare*-ta
- V-*te morau* passives: Analytically marked
  - Example: Mochizuki=ga Kamimura=ni home-*te morat*-ta

## Processing Difficulty in European Passives

- Reading times in English and German
  - Studies by [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019]
- Japanese passives and cognitive load
  - Tamaoka et al.'s findings on sentence comprehension [@Tamaoka_etal2005]

## Cognitive Load in Japanese Passives

- Self-paced reading (SPR) tasks for cognitive load measurement
- Comparing V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*
  - Focus on diathesis processing

## Experiment: Methodology

- Participant recruitment and language history assessment
- Stimuli manipulation: Voice (active vs. passive)
- SPR experiment procedure on PCIbex platform

## Reading Time Results

- Reading time comparison between V-*te morau* passive and V-*te ageru* active
- Bayesian statistical models to interpret reading time data

## Comprehension Question Accuracy

- Accuracy rates for comprehension questions targeting passives vs. actives
- Priming effect of V-*te morau* on V-(*r*)*are* and its implications

## Discussion of Findings

- Reading time differences and cognitive processing
- Accuracy improvement through voice matching in comprehension questions
- Future research directions and limitations

## Conclusion

- Summary of cognitive load findings in Japanese passives
- Contributions to psycholinguistic literature and linguistic typology
- Proposals for future cross-linguistic comparison studies
