You said "konnnichiha," which is a misspelling of "konnichiwa" (こんにちは). "Konnichiwa" is a common Japanese greeting that means "good afternoon" or "hello." It is used during the daytime hours, roughly from late morning until early evening. If this is a language you are using for greetings, it might suggest that you have some connection to the Japanese language, but it does not necessarily mean it is your mother tongue.
