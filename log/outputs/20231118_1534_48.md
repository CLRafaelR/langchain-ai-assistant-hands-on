## Introduction to Psycholinguistics

- Understanding language through psychology
  - Explore how language is acquired, perceived, and produced
  - Investigate the cognitive processes behind language use
- The interplay of language and the mind
  - Examine the relationship between linguistic structures and mental functions
- The role of experiments in psycholinguistics
  - Utilize controlled studies to test hypotheses about language processing

## The Japanese V-*te morau* Passive

- The processing load of passive constructions
  - Analyze the cognitive effort required to understand passive sentences
- Comparison with the active counterpart, V-*te ageru*
  - Contrast passive sentence comprehension with active sentence comprehension
- The significance of verb and post-verb regions
  - Focus on specific sentence parts that may affect processing load

## Experiment Overview

- Self-paced reading task with comprehension questions
  - Measure reading times to infer cognitive processing load
- Moving window paradigm
  - Present text in segments to control exposure and measure reading time accurately
- Investigating Japanese passives
  - Examine whether passives incur a higher processing load than actives

## Participants

- Recruitment and selection criteria
  - 262 native Japanese speakers, screened for language history
- Compensation and ethical considerations
  - Participants received Â¥600 for a 40-minute experiment
- Data exclusion
  - Excluded data based on specific criteria to ensure quality

## Stimuli Design

- Manipulating voice (active vs. passive)
  - Use of benefactive active and passive to observe reading time differences
- Predictive cues in Japanese
  - The role of dative and accusative markers in sentence processing
- Capturing spill-over effects
  - Utilize modal particles to detect processing load beyond the verb region

## Procedure

- Platform and accessibility
  - Conducted via PennController for Internet Based Experiments (PCIbex)
- Trial structure
  - Combination of self-paced reading and comprehension question tasks
- Response and pacing
  - Participants used keyboard keys to respond and control trial progression

## Data Analysis: Exclusion Criteria

- Multiple participations and presentation issues
  - Removal of data to maintain experiment integrity
- Server errors and accuracy thresholds
  - Additional criteria for data exclusion

## Data Analysis: Statistical Models

- Bayesian approach
  - Utilize Bayesian generalised mixed effect models for analysis
- Model fitting and Bayes factors
  - Assess the presence of effects using Bayes factors
- Prior calibration
  - Prior predictive checks to ensure appropriate model specifications

## Predictions for Reading Time

- Predictability and processing load
  - Anticipate shorter reading times for passives due to predictability cues
- Diathesis processing
  - Consider the role of thematic role mapping in reading time differences
- Spill-over and delay effects
  - Explore potential extended processing load in subsequent regions

## Predictions for Comprehension Questions

- Voice match facilitation
  - Expect improved accuracy when question and target sentence voice match
- Priming effects
  - Predict a facilitatory priming effect for passive targets

## Reading Time Results

- Comparison of active and passive targets
  - Observe longer median and mean reading times for passives
- Bayesian evidence
  - Moderate evidence for the effect of target voice under certain conditions

## Accuracy in Comprehension Questions

- Voice and NP order effects
  - Lower accuracy for passive targets and certain NP orders
- Voice matching and accuracy
  - Strong evidence for increased accuracy with voice match in questions
