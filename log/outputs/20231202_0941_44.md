Dear Professor Dr. Emmanuele Chersoni,

I am Masataka Ogawa, the author of submission No. 40. I have safely arrived in Hong Kong and have also received the QR codes for campus access. However, I am unaware of the building name, floor number, and room name where parallel session 1a is to be held on December 2nd. As I am the first presenter today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could provide me with the names of the relevant university facilities.

I look forward to your prompt response.

Carlos
