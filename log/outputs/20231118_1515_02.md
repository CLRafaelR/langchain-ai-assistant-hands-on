## Understanding Passive Construction Difficulty

- Cognitive load in passive vs. active sentences
  - Studies show varying cognitive load in processing passives
  - Importance of understanding the difficulty in comprehension
- Predictability in sentence processing
  - Role of auxiliary verbs and prepositions in prediction
  - How predictability affects reading times for passives

## European Languages: Passives vs. Actives

- English and German passive processing
  - Passives processed with equal or less cognitive load than actives
  - Research by [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019; @Grillo_etal2019]
- Predictability and reading times
  - Auxiliary 'be' and preposition 'by' aid in predicting upcoming elements
  - Passives allow for more predictable non-subject NPs

## Comprehension Challenges in Passives

- Difficulty during comprehension questions
  - Passives create challenges in understanding thematic roles
  - Studies by [@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL; @Meng_Barder2021]
- Accuracy in responses
  - Lower accuracy in active voice comprehension questions after reading passives

## Japanese Passives: Increased Processing Load

- Studies on Japanese V-(*r*)*are* passives
  - Suggest higher processing load compared to actives
  - Research by [@Tamaoka_etal2005; @Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017; @Yokoyama_etal2006]
- Reaction times and error rates
  - Longer reaction times for passives in decision tasks
  - Error rates comparable between passives and actives

## Behavioral and Neurological Evidence in Japanese

- Correct sentence decision task
  - Task performance indicates processing difficulties with passives
  - Study by [@Tamaoka_etal2005]
- fMRI studies on syntactic processing
  - Passives induce more brain activation than actives
  - Studies by [@Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017]

## Disentangling Cognitive Load Factors

- Distinguishing diathesis and voice processing
  - Neural activity may reflect diathesis or voice processing load
  - Study by [@Yokoyama_etal2006]
- Need for further research
  - Direct comparison of actives and passives in accuracy and reading time
  - Elaboration of tasks to measure specific passive processing load
