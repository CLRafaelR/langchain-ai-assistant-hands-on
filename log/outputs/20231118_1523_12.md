## Introduction to Psycholinguistics

- Understanding language through psychology
  - Explore how language is acquired, perceived, and produced
  - Investigate the cognitive processes behind language use
- The intersection of linguistics and cognitive science
  - Combine linguistic theory with psychological experimentation
- The role of Bayesian statistics in psycholinguistics
  - Apply advanced statistical methods to interpret linguistic data
  - Enhance the robustness of psycholinguistic research findings

## The Japanese V-*te morau* Passive

- The processing load of Japanese V-*te morau* passive
  - Compare with the active counterpart, V-*te ageru*
- Predicting processing load at the verb and post-verb regions
  - Examine whether passives increase cognitive demands
- The significance of the study
  - Contribute to the understanding of Japanese sentence processing
  - Address gaps in psycholinguistic literature on passive constructions

## Experiment Overview

- Self-paced reading task with comprehension questions
  - Assess the processing load of different sentence structures
- Moving window paradigm
  - Measure reading times across sentence regions
- Comprehension question task
  - Evaluate participants' understanding of sentence meaning

## Participants

- Recruitment and selection criteria
  - 262 native Japanese speakers from online platforms
  - Screening based on language history and education
- Compensation and ethical considerations
  - Participants received Â¥600 for their time
  - Ensured informed consent and fair treatment

## Stimuli Design

- Manipulation of voice (active vs. passive)
  - Use of V-*te ageru* and V-*te morau* verb forms
- Predictability of passives in Japanese
  - Investigate the role of dative-marked NPs in sentence processing
- Spill-over and delay effects
  - Explore the impact of processing load on subsequent regions

## Procedure

- Platform and accessibility
  - Conducted via PennController for Internet Based Experiments
  - Restricted to computer access, excluding tablets and smartphones
- Trial structure and instructions
  - Explanation of SPR and comprehension tasks through video
- Practice trials
  - Six trials to familiarize participants with the experiment

## Data Analysis: Exclusion Criteria

- Multiple participations and presentation issues
  - Removal of data from participants with suspected multiple entries
- Server errors and accuracy concerns
  - Exclusion based on technical issues and low accuracy rates

## Statistical Models

- Bayesian generalised mixed effect models
  - Analyze data with advanced statistical techniques
- Model fitting and Bayes factor calculation
  - Use of `R` and related packages for comprehensive analysis
- Prior calibration
  - Ensure accurate and reliable model predictions

## Reading Time Predictions

- Antecedent-based predictability
  - Expectation of shorter reading times for passives if predictability is high
- Diathesis processing load
  - Potential for longer reading times due to thematic role mapping

## Comprehension Question Predictions

- Voice match facilitation
  - Anticipate improved accuracy when question and target voice match
- NP order effects
  - Explore how the order of NPs in questions influences accuracy

## Reading Time Results

- Comparison of V-*te morau* passive and V-*te ageru* active
  - Analyze median and mean reading times for verb and modal regions
- Bayes factor interpretation
  - Assess the strength of evidence for the effect of target voice

## Accuracy Results

- Overall accuracy for comprehension questions
  - Examine differences between passive and active targets
- Impact of NP order and voice match
  - Evaluate the influence of question structure on accuracy

## Discussion: Reading Time

- Interpretation of reading time data
  - Discuss implications of longer reading times for passives
- Evidence strength and model predictions
  - Reflect on the reliability of findings based on Bayes factors

## Discussion: Comprehension Accuracy

- Analysis of accuracy patterns
  - Consider the role of voice match and NP order in question understanding
- Evidence for facilitatory effects
  - Discuss the significance of strong evidence for voice matching

## Conclusion

- Summary of findings
  - Highlight key results from the reading time and accuracy data
- Contributions to psycholinguistics
  - Emphasize the study's impact on understanding Japanese sentence processing
- Future directions
  - Suggest areas for further research based on current findings
