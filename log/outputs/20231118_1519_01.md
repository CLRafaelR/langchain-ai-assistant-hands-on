## Slide 1: Introduction to the SPR Experiment

- Objective of the SPR experiment
  - Investigate cognitive load in Japanese V-*te morau* passive vs. V-*te ageru* active
- Methodology
  - Moving window self-paced reading (SPR) task
  - Comprehension question task to follow SPR

## Slide 2: Participants

- Recruitment and selection
  - 262 native Japanese speakers recruited online
  - Screening based on language history and education
- Compensation and duration
  - Participants received Â¥600 for a 40-minute experiment

## Slide 3: Stimuli Design

- Voice manipulation
  - V-*te ageru* active and V-*te morau* passive as main verb chunks
- Predictability and reading times
  - Potential predictability of passives with *=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP
  - Reading time measured at verb and modal particle regions

## Slide 4: Comprehension Questions

- Structure and variations
  - Four versions of questions to counterbalance 'yes' or 'no' answers
- Voice matching effect
  - Investigating facilitatory effect of voice match between question and target

## Slide 5: Experimental Procedure

- Platform and accessibility
  - Experiment conducted on PCIbex, no tablet or smartphone access
- Trial structure
  - SPR task followed by a comprehension question, 64 trials in total

## Slide 6: Data Analysis - Exclusion Criteria

- Multiple participations and presentation issues
  - Removal of data from participants with suspected multiple participations or presentation errors
- Reading time anomalies
  - Exclusion of reading times less than 50 ms

## Slide 7: Data Analysis - Statistical Models

- Bayesian approach
  - Generalised mixed effect models with Bayesian statistics
- Model fitting and Bayes factors
  - Testing explanatory variables' effects on response variables

## Slide 8: Predictions for Reading Time

- Predictability based on antecedents
  - Shorter reading times for passives if *=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP aids prediction
- Diathesis processing load
  - Longer reading times for passives may indicate diathesis processing load

## Slide 9: Predictions for Comprehension Questions

- Facilitatory priming effect
  - Voice match between target and question expected to increase accuracy
- NP order influence
  - Effect of NP order in questions on accuracy rates

## Slide 10: Results Overview

- Reading time findings
  - Median and mean reading times longer for V-*te morau* passive
- Comprehension question accuracy
  - Lower accuracy for V-*te morau* passive, voice matching effect observed
