## Reading Time in Japanese Passives

- V-*te morau* passives show longer reading times than V-*te ageru* actives
  - Contrasts with findings in English and German [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Grillo_etal2019]
- Bayes factors provide ambiguous support
  - Neither confirm nor deny the effect of voice on reading time

## Morphological Processing in Japanese Passives

- Similar morphological composition in V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*
  - May lead to equivalent processing load and time
- Comparison with other languages
  - Only passives tend to be morphosyntactically complex in English and German

## Comprehension Accuracy and Priming Effects

- Lower accuracy for V-*te morau* passive targets
  - Suggests difficulty in mapping patient to grammatical subject
- Priming effect from V-*te morau* to V-(*r*)*are*
  - Facilitates processing of V-(*r*)*are* passives [@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL]

## Discussion on Cognitive Processing

- Representation of patient roles
  - Possible broad patientive macrorole in native speakers' parser
- Impact of NP order on priming
  - Facilitating effect only when NP order is consistent between target and question

## Conclusion and Future Research

- No decrease in reading time for passives
  - Morphological cues may have limited impact in Japanese
- Need for cross-linguistic studies
  - Equipollent alternation in languages like Finnish, Kafa, and Sinhala [@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book]
- Limitations of the study
  - Priming effect dependent on consistent NP order
