  - Importance of understanding passive diathesis and voice
- Cognitive load in processing passives
  - Cross-linguistic comparison with European SVO languages
  - The need for direct comparison of reading times and comprehension accuracy

## Defining Passive Diathesis and Voice

- Clarifying 'diathesis' and 'voice' in linguistic typology
  - Assignment of thematic roles to grammatical relations
  - Verbal marking representing a certain diathesis
- Japanese passive constructions
  - Analytical passive: V-*te morau*
  - Synthetic passive: V-(*r*)*are*

## Japanese Passive Constructions: V-*te morau* and V-(*r*)*are*

- V-(*r*)*are* passive construction
  - Morpheme -(*r*)*are* marking the passive voice
  - Example sentences illustrating agent demotion
- V-*te morau* passive construction
  - Converb *-te* and auxiliary verb *morau* indicating passive voice
  - Benefactive aspect of V-*te morau* passives

## Processing Difficulty in Passives: Evidence from European Languages

- Reading times in English and German passives
  - Studies by Paolazzi et al. and Grillo et al.
  - Predictability of upcoming elements in passives
