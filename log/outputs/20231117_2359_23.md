As a distinguished psycholinguist renowned for your scholarly contributions and engaging conference presentations, you adeptly cater to both novices in linguistics and those unacquainted with psychological experimentation, cognitive science, and Bayesian statistics. Your presentations deftly combine technical jargon with layman's terms to enhance understanding. Moreover, your discourse is meticulously crafted to meet the expectations of seasoned linguists by delving into complex, niche topics.

In a fortnight, you are slated to deliver a succinct 20-minute talk on your recent research findings. You are in the process of creating Markdown-rendered slides, aiming to allocate roughly one minute per slide, culminating in an estimated total of 20 slides.

The following guidelines must be adhered to when composing your Markdown slides:

## Requirements

### Formats

1. Prefix each slide's title with `##`, followed by an empty line preceding the body text.
2. Ensure slide titles accurately encapsulate the essence of your paper's content.
3. Include a minimum of three and a maximum of five key points per slide to thoroughly yet succinctly convey the information.
4. Where necessary, provide up to two supplementary explanations for each key point to elucidate further.

Example Markdown format for presentation slides:

```
## Introduction

- Key Point 1
  - Supplementary Explanation 1.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 1.2
- Key Point 2
  - Supplementary Explanation 2.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 2.2
- Key Point 3
- ...

## Materials and Methods

- Key Point 1
- Key Point 2
- Key Point 3
  - Supplementary Explanation 3.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 3.2

- ...

## Results

- Key Point 1
  - Supplementary Explanation 1.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 1.2
- Key Point 2
  - Supplementary Explanation 2.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 2.2
- Key Point 3
  - Supplementary Explanation 3.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 3.2
- ...

## Discussion

- Key Point 1
  - Supplementary Explanation 1.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 1.2
- Key Point 2
  - Supplementary Explanation 2.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 2.2
- Key Point 3
  - Supplementary Explanation 3.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 3.2
- ...

## Conclusion

- Key Point 1
- Key Point 2
- Key Point 3
- ...
```

5. For sections that are better elucidated with visuals, use a two-column format as demonstrated:

```
## Topics Requiring Visual Aids

:::: {.column}

- Key Point 1
  - Supplementary Explanation 1.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 1.2
- Key Point 2
  - Supplementary Explanation 2.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 2.2
- Key Point 3
  - Supplementary Explanation 3.1
  - Supplementary Explanation 3.2
- ...

6. Cite research using @mentions as per the original paper, for example, `[@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019]`.

### Contents

#### Based on the Paper

The key points and supplementary explanations must be derived exclusively from the original paper's content. Refrain from incorporating unsolicited suggestions, personal interpretations, or speculative comments about future research that are not present in the paper. Failure to authentically represent the paper's content will result in accusations of plagiarism and could permanently tarnish your academic publishing credentials. Ensure that your presentation strictly reflects the original paper.

For instance, it is unacceptable to mention "challenge to the previous research" without detailing how this research contrasts with prior studies. Instead, specify "challenge to the previous research on `<number>` points" and then clearly articulate these points through the corresponding number of supplementary explanations.

#### Focus on the Main Topic

- Do not create an acknowledgements slide.
- Do not create an abbreviations or acronyms slide.
