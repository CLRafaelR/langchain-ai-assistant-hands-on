## Introduction to Japanese Passive Constructions

- Distinction between V-*te morau* and V-(*r*)*are* passives
  - V-*te morau* as an analytical passive construction
  - V-(*r*)*are* as a synthetic passive construction
- Importance of passive constructions in psycholinguistics
  - Challenges in processing passives across languages
  - The need for direct comparison of reading times and comprehension accuracy

## Defining Passive Diathesis and Voice in Japanese

- Passive diathesis: Mapping thematic patient role to syntactic subject
  - Demotion of agent role to an optional adjunct or oblique
- Passive voice: Verbal marking indicating passive diathesis
  - Synthetic marking with morphemes
  - Analytical marking with auxiliary verbs

## Japanese Passive Constructions: V-*te morau* and V-(*r*)*are*

- V-(*r*)*are* passive: Synthetically marked by the morpheme -(*r*)*are*
  - Example: Mochizuki=ga Kamimura=ni home-*rare*-ta (Mochizuki was praised by Kamimura)
- V-*te morau* passive: Analytically marked by the auxiliary verb *morau*
  - Example: Mochizuki=ga Kamimura=ni home-*te morat*-ta (Mochizuki was praised by Kamimura)

## Processing Difficulty in Passives: Evidence from European Languages

- Reading times in English and German passives
  - Studies by [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019] and [@Grillo_etal2019]
  - Predictability of upcoming elements in passives
- Processing load in Japanese passives
  - Studies by [@Tamaoka_etal2005; @Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017]
  - Greater load on morphological processing [@Yokoyama_etal2006]

## Japanese Passives: Processing Challenges at Different Stages

- Identifying difficult phrases in Japanese passives
  - Use of self-paced reading (SPR) tasks to measure cognitive load
- Rationale for comparing V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*
  - Minimizing morphological complexity differences
  - Exploring diathesis processing in Japanese

## Experiment: Methodology and Design

- Participants: 262 native Japanese speakers
  - Language history assessment following [@Linzen_Oseki2018]
- Stimuli: Manipulation of voice (active vs. passive)
  - Use of V-*te ageru* benefactive active and V-*te morau* benefactive passive
- Procedure: SPR experiment conducted on PCIbex platform
  - Presentation of stimuli and response collection

## Results: Reading Time Analysis

- Reading time data for verb and modal particle regions
  - Comparison of V-*te morau* passive and V-*te ageru* active
- Bayesian statistical models and evidence
  - Interpretation of Bayes factors and credible intervals

## Results: Comprehension Question Accuracy

- Accuracy rates for comprehension questions
  - Effect of voice match between target and question
- Priming effect of V-*te morau* on V-(*r*)*are*
  - Implications for patientive macrorole representation

## Discussion: Insights and Implications

- Reading time differences and cognitive processing
  - Comparison with previous studies in SVO languages
- Accuracy improvement and voice matching
  - Priming effects and cognitive representation of roles
- Limitations and directions for future research
  - Generalizability and exploration of primability

## Conclusion: Understanding Japanese Passives

- Summary of findings on cognitive load in Japanese passives
  - Contributions to psycholinguistic literature
- Implications for linguistic typology and cognitive science
  - The role of passive constructions in language processing
- Acknowledging limitations and proposing future studies
  - Expanding cross-linguistic comparisons and role primability
