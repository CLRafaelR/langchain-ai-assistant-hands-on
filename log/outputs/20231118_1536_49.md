## Reading Time Differences in Japanese Passives

- Longer reading times for V-*te morau* passives
  - Contrasts with shorter passive reading times in English and German studies [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Grillo_etal2019]
- Ambiguous Bayes factor results
  - No clear support for the effect of voice on reading time differences
- Morphological similarity between V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*
  - Similar processing load may be required for both constructions

## Processing Load in Japanese Passives

- Morphological complexity and cognitive demand
  - Comparison with morphologically complex markers in other languages
- Diathesis processing in Japanese
  - Potential differences in brain activation for syntactic processing
- Need for further research
  - Suggests exploring other behavioral measurements for clarity

## Comprehension Accuracy for Japanese Passives

- Lower accuracy for V-*te morau* passive targets
  - Indicates syntactic factors may induce comprehension difficulty
- Priming effects in comprehension
  - V-*te morau* primes V-(*r*)*are*, facilitating processing and retrieval
- Diathesis mismatch impact
  - Voice mismatch affects post-interpretive processes for V-*te ageru* actives

## General Discussion

- The cognitive representation of patient roles
  - Suggests a broad patientive macrorole in native speakers' parser
- NP order and priming effects
  - Facilitating priming effect only when NP order is consistent
- Implications for psycholinguistic theory
  - Raises questions about the representation and processing of passive constructions

## Conclusion and Future Directions

- Morphological cues and reading time
  - No reduction in reading times for passives despite morphological signals
- Cross-linguistic validation
  - Proposes studies in languages with equipollent alternation for comparison
- Limitations and scope for future research
  - Investigate the primability of patientive roles across different constructions
