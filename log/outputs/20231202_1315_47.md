## Predictions on Reading Times

- Predicted shorter reading times for passives based on predictability [@Paolazzi_etal2019; @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL].
- Japanese markers *=ni* and *=o* may signal passive or active voice, influencing reading times.
- If *=ni*-marked NP is not a strong predictor, V-*te morau* passives may take longer to read.

## Predictions on Comprehension Questions

- Expected facilitatory effect for passives when question matches the target's voice [@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL].
- Predicted that voice match between question and target would improve accuracy in Japanese as well.

## Reading Time Results

- Median and mean reading times were longer for V-*te morau* passives.
- Bayes factors showed moderate evidence for the effect of voice only with constrained priors.
- Results suggest little impact of voice contrast on reading times.

## Accuracy Results

- Lower accuracy observed for V-*te morau* passive targets.
- Strong evidence for the effect of voice on accuracy as prior SD increases.
- Voice matching between question and target significantly increased accuracy.

## General Discussion

- Contrary to previous studies, V-*te morau* passives had longer reading times than V-*te ageru* actives.
- Morphological cues in Japanese may not facilitate passive reading as in other languages.
- Further research needed to compare V-(*r*)*are* passives and V-$\emptyset$ actives.

## Conclusion

- Japanese V-*te morau* passives are more challenging to comprehend than V-*te ageru* actives.
- The study highlights the importance of morphological cues in sentence processing.
- Future work should explore cross-linguistic comparisons and the concept of a patientive macrorole.
