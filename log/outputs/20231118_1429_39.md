## Introduction to Passive Diathesis and Voice

- Definition of 'diathesis' and 'voice'
  - Diathesis: Assignment of thematic roles to grammatical relations
  - Voice: Verbal marking representing a certain diathesis
- Passive diathesis and voice
  - Passive diathesis: Maps thematic patient role to syntactic subject
  - Passive voice: Verb marker indicating passive diathesis
- Distinction between synthetic and analytical marking
  - Synthetic: Uses a morpheme to indicate passive
  - Analytical: Combines a non-finite verb form with a functional auxiliary verb

## Japanese Passive Constructions

- V-(*r*)*are* passive
  - Morpheme -(*r*)*are* marks the passive voice synthetically
  - Patient expressed by nominative subject, agent by dative oblique
- V-*te morau* passive
  - Analytical passive construction with auxiliary verb *morau*
  - Indicates an event where the agent's action benefits the patient
- Comparison with active counterparts
  - V-*te ageru* as the active counterpart to V-*te morau*
  - V-$\emptyset$ active as the counterpart to V-(*r*)*are* passive

## Cognitive Load in Passive Processing

- Previous research on European SVO languages
  - Passives processed with equal or less cognitive load than actives
  - Studies: [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019 in English; @Grillo_etal2019 in German]
- Japanese passives and processing difficulty
  - Japanese V-(*r*)*are* passives suggest increased processing difficulty
  - Studies: [@Tamaoka_etal2005; @Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017]
- Limitations in previous Japanese studies
  - Lack of reading time measurements
  - Morphological complexity not controlled between passive and active

## Experiment Rationale

- Focus on V-*te morau* benefactive passive and V-*te ageru* active
  - Controlled for morphological complexity
- Self-paced reading (SPR) task
  - Participants read sentences at their own pace
- Comprehension question task
  - Used normal active V-$\emptyset$ or V-(*r*)*are* passive for questions

## Experiment Findings

- Reading times for V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*
  - No significant difference in reading times between the two constructions
- Comprehension accuracy
  - Enhanced accuracy for V-*te morau* when questions used V-(*r*)*are* passive
- Implications for patientive macrorole
  - Primability of patient-like beneficiaries and normal patients

## Passive Diathesis in Japanese: V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau*

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column}

- V-(*r*)*are* passive construction
  - Subject assigned to patient, agent demoted to oblique
- V-*te morau* passive construction
  - Beneficiary as patient, marked by nominative
- Differences between V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau*
  - V-*te morau* implies benefit to the patient from the agent's action

## Typological Perspective on Benefactive Constructions

- Beneficiary vs. patient distinction
  - Beneficiaries often coded differently from patients
  - Beneficiaries indirectly affected, patients directly affected
- V-*te morau* and human-to-human actions
  - Beneficiary in subject position also a patient
  - Directly affected by the event and marked nominatively

## Discussion and Implications

- Review of passive processing in different languages
  - Comparison of cognitive load in European languages and Japanese
- Significance of V-*te morau* construction
  - Challenges the traditional beneficiary-patient distinction
- Broader implications for patientive macrorole
  - Potential overlap between patient-like beneficiaries and normal patients
