Your answer returns the following warning message:

```
A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead

See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy
  retrieved_refs_gpt_4['extracted_source'] = retrieved_refs_gpt_4['source'].apply(extract_formatted_strings)
```

Modify your previous answer to remove this warning. Don't include the definition of `extract_formatted_strings` since I copied that.
