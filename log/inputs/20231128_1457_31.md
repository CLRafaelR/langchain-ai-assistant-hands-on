Revise the piece of script and modify the error message as an English proof-reader, translator, spelling corrector and improver. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in British English. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with clearer, more understandable, more concise, and upper level English words and sentences. Keep the meaning same, but make them more concise, formal and official.
