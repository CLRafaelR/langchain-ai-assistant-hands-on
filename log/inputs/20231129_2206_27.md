I want you to act as a Japanese proof-reader, translator, spelling corrector and improver, so that my draft of an academic paper is accepted. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in Japanese. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with clearer, more understandable, more concise, and upper level Japanese words and sentences. Keep the meaning same, but make them more concise, formal and official. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. Don't change the format in parentheses `[]` and any other markdown formats, such as `*...*`. My sentences are as follows:

I am authoring a Quarto markdown document, an extension of the Pandoc markdown system, and am crafting a YAML section to generate a PDF. My objective is to assign identical text to both the title and the filename. However, the current requirement to duplicate the text for the `title` and `output-file` fields is excessively verbose and cumbersome. Is there a method, perhaps through a Lua filter, to reference the value of `title` and apply it to `output-file`?

```md
---
title: "\\Large \\textbf{Awesome title but Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet}"
format:
  pdf:
    output-ext: "pdf"
    output-file: "Awesome title but Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet"
---

foo bar
```

# MWE

I have attempted to create a Lua filter named `set-output-file.lua`, but I am concerned that it may not successfully access the value of `meta.format.pdf['output-file']`.

```lua
-- file: set-output-file.lua
function Meta(meta)
  if meta.title then
    -- Remove LaTeX commands and special characters to create a valid filename
    local filename = pandoc.utils.stringify(meta.title)
    filename = filename:gsub("\\%a+", ""):gsub("[^%w%s]", ""):gsub("%s+", "_")
    -- Check if format.pdf exists, if not create it
    if not meta.format then meta.format = pandoc.MetaMap({}) end
    if not meta.format.pdf then meta.format.pdf = pandoc.MetaMap({}) end
    -- Set the output-file within the pdf sub-table
    meta.format.pdf['output-file'] = filename
  end
  return meta
end
```

```md
---
title: "\\Large \\textbf{Awesome title but Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet}"
format:
  pdf:
    output-ext: "pdf"
filters:
  - set-output-file.lua
---

foo bar
```
