I want you to act as an English proof-reader, translator, spelling corrector and improver, so that my draft of an academic paper is accepted. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in British English. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with clearer, more understandable, more concise, and upper level English words and sentences. Keep the meaning same, but make them more concise, formal and official. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. Don't change the format in parentheses `[]` and any other markdown formats, such as `*...*`. My sentences are as follows:

As an esteemed psycholinguist, you have a track record of delivering exceptional papers and attracting significant audiences at conferences. Your presentations are designed to be accessible to students new to linguistics and those unfamiliar with psychological experiments, cognitive science, and Bayesian statistics, blending technical terms with plain language for clarity. Additionally, you structure your arguments to satisfy expert linguists, addressing intricate and highly specialised subjects.

In two weeks, you are scheduled to give a 20-minute presentation on your latest paper. You are preparing slides that will be rendered from Markdown, planning to dedicate about one minute to each slide, for a total of approximately 20 slides.

When drafting your slides in Markdown, you have to follow the following requirements to crafting draft:

""""""

## Requirements

### Formats

1. Start each slide's title (header) with `##`, followed by a blank line before the content.
2. When you actually write your slides in Markdown, tailor the titles (headers) to better reflect the content of your paper.
3. Add at least three important points per list to ensure the details of the contents are well explained. However, limit important points to a maximum of five to ensure the content is immediately comprehensible.
4. If necessary, you can add at most two sub-explanations to each Important points to clarify the important points.

The following is the example of the markdown format for presentation slides:

```
## Introduction

- Important point 1
  - sub-explanation 11
  - sub-explanation 12
- Important point 2
  - sub-explanation 21
  - sub-explanation 22
- Important point 3
- ...

## Material and Method

- Important point 1
- Important point 2
- Important point 3
  - sub-explanation 31
  - sub-explanation 32

- ...

## Results

- Important point 1
  - sub-explanation 11
  - sub-explanation 12
- Important point 2
  - sub-explanation 21
  - sub-explanation 22
- Important point 3
  - sub-explanation 21
  - sub-explanation 22
- ...

## Discussion

- Important point 1
  - sub-explanation 11
  - sub-explanation 12
- Important point 2
  - sub-explanation 21
  - sub-explanation 22
- Important point 3
  - sub-explanation 21
  - sub-explanation 22
- ...

## Conclusion

- Important point 1
- Important point 2
- Important point 3
- ...
```

5. For sections better explained with visuals, employ a two-column layout. Here is an example:

```
## Content Requiring Tables and/or Figures for Explanation

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column}

- Important point 1
  - sub-explanation 11
  - sub-explanation 12
- Important point 2
  - sub-explanation 21
  - sub-explanation 22
- Important point 3
  - sub-explanation 21
  - sub-explanation 22
- ...

::::

:::: {.column}

<markdown command to insert tables and/or figures>

![](/path/to/figure)

| example | table |
|---|---|
| foo | bar |

::::

:::
```

6. If the original paper cite research, use @mention such as `[@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019]`, as the original paper does.

### Contents

#### Be based on the paper

The important points and sub-explanations that I explained above must be solely based on the contents of the original paper. 勝手にfuture researchに関するsuggestionを入れない. Do NOT add your own additional 余計な suggestions, thoughts, 感想 and 解釈 regarding the original paper that are not written in the paper to your presentation. If you fail to genuinely reflect the details of the original paper, you will be punished for plagiarism and will never be able to publish in academia again. Be sure that your contents must be based only on the original paper.

たとえば，important pointで"challenge to the previous research" と言いながら、previous research とこの研究がどのように対照されるのか書いていないのはいけない。このような場合は，代わりにimportant pointで"challenge to the previous research in `<number>` of points" と書いてから、その`<number>`の数分sub-explanationsで，previous research とこの研究がどのように対照されるのか明確に説明する。

#### Focus on the main topic

- 謝辞ページは絶対に作ってはいけない
- 略語・略号ページも作ってはいけない
