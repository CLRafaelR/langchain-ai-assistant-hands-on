As an esteemed psycholinguist, you have a track record of delivering exceptional papers and attracting significant audiences at conferences. Your presentations are designed to be accessible to students new to linguistics and those unfamiliar with psychological experiments, cognitive science, and Bayesian statistics, blending technical terms with plain language for clarity. Additionally, you structure your arguments to satisfy expert linguists, addressing intricate and highly specialised subjects.

In two weeks, you are scheduled to give a 20-minute presentation on your latest paper. You are preparing slides that will be rendered from Markdown, planning to dedicate about one minute to each slide, for a total of approximately 20 slides.

The following guidelines must be adhered to when composing your Markdown slides:

## Requirements

### Formats

1. Prefix each slide's title with `##`, followed by an empty line preceding the body text.
2. Ensure slide titles accurately encapsulate the essence of your paper's content.
3. Include a minimum of three and a maximum of five key points per slide to thoroughly yet succinctly convey the information.
4. Where necessary, provide two or three supplementary explanations for each key point to elucidate further. You have to update the explanation of a key point itself, rather than adding just one supplementary explanation to a key point, if you only come up with just one supplementary explanation. By following this, there must be two or three supplementary explanations per key point, where such supplementary explanations are required to clearly understand why and how much the key point is important to the psycholinguistic literature.

Example Markdown format for presentation slides:

6. For sections that are better elucidated with visuals, use a two-column format as demonstrated. The figures and tables that must be used are specified in the original paper in LaTeX code block:
7. Cite research using @mentions as per the original paper, for example, `[@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019]`.


### Contents

#### Based on the paper

The key points and supplementary explanations must be derived exclusively from the original paper's content. Refrain from incorporating unsolicited suggestions, personal interpretations, or speculative comments that are not present in the paper. Failure to authentically represent the paper's content will result in accusations of plagiarism and could permanently tarnish your academic publishing credentials. Ensure that your presentation strictly reflects the original paper.

#### State key points clearly and effectively use their supplementary expectations

For example, it is unacceptable to mention "challenge to the previous research" as a key point without supplementary explanation detailing how this research contrasts with prior studies. Instead, specify "challenge to the previous research on `<number>` points" and then clearly articulate these points through the corresponding number of supplementary explanations.
If you only come up with just one supplementary explanation, you have to rewrite the explanation of a key point itself, rather than adding just one supplementary explanation to a key point, to make the key point is more concrete than before.

#### Focus on the Main Topic

- Do not create an acknowledgements slide.
- Do not create an abbreviations or acronyms slide.

#### Explain the original paper in detail

In the following paper, Section `Are passives more difficult to comprehend than actives?` (`\@ref(sec:passive-difficulty)`)
reviews experimental results in English, German, and Japanese that measured processing difficulties in passives. Explain the previous psycholinguistic literature so that numerous participants who are unfamiliar with psycholinguistics will track the arguments and debates regarding measuring the cognitive difficulty that passive constructions cause, using three or four slides.

# Are passives more difficult to comprehend than actives? {#sec:passive-difficulty}

## Processing difficulty of passives found in European languages

Paolazzi and colleagues [-@Paolazzi_etal2016; -@Paolazzi_etal2017; -@Paolazzi_etal2019]  conducted SPR experiments in English and argued that the reading time necessary for the verb and post-verb regions in passives was shorter than or the same as that which was necessary for actives. They suggested that the auxiliary verb *be* and the preposition *by* in the passives contribute to readers' prediction of the (post-)verb region. For instance, the input of the sentence-initial NP in actives triggers various predictions about the upcoming elements, as different elements other than a verb can also follow that NP. Therefore, this makes it relatively less likely to predict whether a verb will immediately follow the sentence-initial NP. Conversely, in passives, the input of the auxiliary verb *be* makes it more predictable that a verb (in past participle form) will follow *be*. Thus, Paolazzi et al [-@Paolazzi_etal2019; -@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL]  claim that elements preceding the verb region elevate predictability for verbs in passives compared to in actives, leading to shorter reading times for verbs in passives than in actives. They also argued that a non-subject NP might be more predictable in passives than in actives, which resulted in faster reading times for the post-verb region in passives, since the combination of a verb and the preposition *by* in passives signalled a non-subject NP, whilst in actives only the verb is available for such a prediction.

@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL also emphasised that the processing difficulties for passives arises during comprehension questions in active voice targeting thematic roles (i.e. questions asking *who* did something to *whom*). They also argued that processing difficulties for passives hardly occurs during the reading process itself. Similar results were also found in German [@Grillo_etal2019; @Meng_Barder2021].    @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL also showed that participants responded less accurately to comprehension questions in active voice asking about thematic relations after they read passive targets.
  

## Previous findings on the processing load for Japanese V-(*r*)*are* passives compared to V-$\emptyset$ actives

Experimental results in Japanese also suggest that passives have a higher processing load than actives. In particular, several studies have suggested that passives make sentence comprehension [@Tamaoka_etal2005] and syntactic processing [@Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017] more difficult than actives, and that passive verbs put a greater load on morphological processing than active verbs [@Yokoyama_etal2006].

### Behavioural response study using a correct sentence decision task

@Tamaoka_etal2005 presented various constructions ---including actives and passives in the canonical order (subject-to-non-subject) and scrambled order (non-subject-to-subject)---to participants and had them perform a correct sentence decision task, asking them to judge whether each sentence made sense. Their results indicate that in both scrambled and canonical conditions, the reaction times for passives were noticeably longer than for actives, even though the error rates of both constructions were comparable, and suggest that human parsers encounter more processing difficulties with passives than actives.

(ref:cap-Tamaoka-etal2005) The error rate and reaction time in the making-sense judgement task reported by @Tamaoka_etal2005. Error bars indicate 95% confidence interval calculated by Masataka Ogawa based on the originally reported SD and number of participants.

Nonetheless, further evidence is called for to confirm whether Japanese passives are in fact more cognitively demanding than actives. It is necessary 1. to directly compare actives and passives, both in accuracy and reading time, and 2. to elaborate the task to measure the processing load of passives. Since @Tamaoka_etal2005 used ungrammatical or implausible sentences for the targets, the processing load measured in the task might only reflect that general syntactico-semantic anomalies are less detectable in passives. Therefore, a different experiment is required to detect the cognitive load specific to passives.

### fMRI studies

@Kinno_etal2008 and @Tanaka_etal2017 conducted a picture-sentence matching task to capture the differences in brain activation elicited by Japanese V-$\emptyset$ actives and V-(*r*)are passives, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the reaction times. In a trial, they showed participants a picture depicting one of two stick figures acting on the other (e.g. to push) along with a written sentence. Participants were asked to judge whether the sentence correctly described the picture. The sentence described the picture either accurately or inaccurately by reversing the agent and patient. They found that passives induced more brain activation than actives. This neural activation tendency was statistically significant in @Kinno_etal2008, who concluded that this activation was due to the syntactic reanalysis required to comprehend that the patient was expressed by a nominative =*ga*-marked NP in passives. 

(ref:cap-Kinno-etal2008) The accuracy rate and reaction time in the picture-sentence matching task by @Kinno_etal2008, where 14 participants took part in and 6 items were used. Error bars indicate 95% confidence interval calculated by Masataka Ogawa based on the originally reported SD and number of participants. AS: active sentence in canonical SOV order; PS: passive sentence in canonical SOV order; SC: control condition using ($\bigcirc$*=to* $\square$*=ga* V[intr]{.smallcaps} '$\bigcirc$ and $\square$ is doing something denoted by the intransitive verb'); SS: scrambled active sentence in OSV order.

(ref:cap-Yokoyama-etal2006) The accuracy rate and reaction time in the lexical decision task by @Yokoyama_etal2006, where 30 participants took part in and 28 items were used. Error bars indicate 95% confidence interval calculated by Masataka Ogawa based on the originally reported SD and number of participants.

However, processing difficulty in passive syntactic structures may not be the only factor that activates the left inferior frontal gyrus.   @Yokoyama_etal2006 observed a similar activation pattern in a lexical decision task meant primarily to compare the cognitive demands of uninflected (i.e. morphologically unmarked) V-$\emptyset$ active verbs and inflected (i.e. morphologically marked) V-(*r*)*are* passive verbs in Japanese. They concluded that the activation difference reflected that inflectionally unmarked active verbs are processed as a single word, whilst inflectionally marked passive verbs further require inflectional processing that decomposes them into morphological units. Therefore, it remains unclear whether this kind of neural activity reflects the cognitive load necessary for the processing of the diathesis (sentence level; whether a subject or object/oblique expresses the agent or patient) or the voice (verb chunk level; the verb form used to express the diathesis).
