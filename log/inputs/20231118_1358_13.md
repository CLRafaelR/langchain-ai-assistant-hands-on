As an esteemed psycholinguist, you have a track record of delivering exceptional papers and attracting significant audiences at conferences. Your presentations are designed to be accessible to students new to linguistics and those unfamiliar with psychological experiments, cognitive science, and Bayesian statistics, blending technical terms with plain language for clarity. Additionally, you structure your arguments to satisfy expert linguists, addressing intricate and highly specialised subjects.

In two weeks, you are scheduled to give a 20-minute presentation on your latest paper. You are preparing slides that will be rendered from Markdown, planning to dedicate about one minute to each slide, for a total of approximately 20 slides.

The following guidelines must be adhered to when composing your Markdown slides:

""""""

## Requirements

### Formats

1. Prefix each slide's title with `##`, followed by an empty line preceding the body text.
2. Ensure slide titles accurately encapsulate the essence of your paper's content.
3. Include a minimum of three and a maximum of five key points per slide to thoroughly yet succinctly convey the information.
4. Where necessary, provide two or three supplementary explanations for each key point to elucidate further. You have to update the explanation of a key point itself, rather than adding just one supplementary explanation to a key point, if you only come up with just one supplementary explanation. By following this, there must be two or three supplementary explanations per key point, where such supplementary explanations are required to clearly understand why and how much the key point is important to the psycholinguistic literature.

### Contents

#### Based on the paper

The key points and supplementary explanations must be derived exclusively from the original paper's content. Refrain from incorporating unsolicited suggestions, personal interpretations, or speculative comments that are not present in the paper. Failure to authentically represent the paper's content will result in accusations of plagiarism and could permanently tarnish your academic publishing credentials. Ensure that your presentation strictly reflects the original paper.

#### State key points clearly and effectively use their supplementary expectations

For example, it is unacceptable to mention "challenge to the previous research" as a key point without supplementary explanation detailing how this research contrasts with prior studies. Instead, specify "challenge to the previous research on `<number>` points" and then clearly articulate these points through the corresponding number of supplementary explanations.
If you only come up with just one supplementary explanation, you have to rewrite the explanation of a key point itself, rather than adding just one supplementary explanation to a key point, to make the key point is more concrete than before.

#### Focus on the Main Topic

- Do not create an acknowledgements slide.
- Do not create an abbreviations or acronyms slide.

#### Explain the original paper in detail

In the following paper, Section `Definition of passive diathesis and voice and Japanese passive voices` (`\@ref(sec:def-passive-Japanese-passive)`) outlines the definition of 'passive' and how passive is expressed in Japanese using V-*te morau* and V-(*r*)*are* constructions. Explain the Japanese constructions understandably since number of participants who are unfamiliar with Japanese will attend to the conference, using three or four slides.

Section `Are passives more difficult to comprehend than actives?` (`\@ref(sec:passive-difficulty)`)
reviews experimental results in English, German, and Japanese that measured processing difficulties in passives. Explain the previous psycholinguistic literature so that numerous participants who are unfamiliar with psycholinguistics will track the arguments and debates regarding measuring the cognitive difficulty that passive constructions cause, using three or four slides.

Section `At what stage are Japanese passives difficult to understand?` (`\@ref(sec:periphrastic-passive-rationale)`) justifies the comparison of V-*te morau* passive and V-*te ageru* active, not V-(*r*)*are* passive and V-$\emptyset$ active. Explain why and how Japanese passive construction, especially benefactive passive, can contribute to the psycholinguistic dispute, using one slide.

Section `Experiment: Self-paced reading task with comprehension question` (`\@ref(sec:expt-benefactive-cq)`) reports the methodology and results of our SPR experiment. There must be numerous audience who do have any idea of the methodology of reading time measurement and comprehension question, and statistics that rationale your arguments in the conference. Therefore, you have to explain the method and results in detail step by step, so that the audience can understand the prediction of experiments, how you conducted experiments and how your results can be interpreted. Use seven slides to achieve this.

A discussion follows in Section (`\@ref(sec:discussion)`). You must explain how the current reading time and accuracy of Japanese benefactive passives elucidate the cognitive process of understanding passive constructions. You have also to mention limitations that are stated in `Conclusion and limitations` in the original paper. Use five slides in total.

In European SVO languages, the cognitive load required for the
processing of passives, as measured by reading times and accuracy to
comprehension questions, was the same as or less than that for the
active.  
[@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019 in
English; @Grillo_etal2019 in German]. On the other hand, the results of
experiments using Japanese V-(*r*)*are* passive suggest that passives
 can create a processing difficulty
[@Tamaoka_etal2005; @Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017]. However,
previous research on Japanese passives did not measure reading time,
impeding direct cross-linguistic comparisons of reading time and
comprehension accuracy. Moreover, these studies used a pair of
constructions in which the passive verb chunk is not only syntactically
but also morphologically more complex than the active verb chunk.


We conducted an experiment to compare reading times between V-*te morau*
benefactive passive and its counterpart, V-*te ageru* benefactive
active,  controlling the morphological complexity. In this
experiment, participants read sentences chunk by chunk at their own pace
(i.e. a self-paced reading \[SPR\] task) targeting either of those two
benefactive constructions, and then completed a comprehension question
task using either the normal active V-$\emptyset$ or V-(*r*)*are*
passive. 

No evidence was found to support  the hypothesis that the
reading time needed for V-*te morau* benefactive passives was different
from   the time needed for their counterpart V-*te
ageru* benefactive actives. Nonetheless, accuracy in the comprehension
question targeting V-*te morau* benefactive passives was drastically
enhanced when the question itself used V-(*r*)*are* passive. This
indicates the primability of patient-like beneficiaries and normal
patients and implies that they may compose of a broad patientive
macrorole.     

Section \@ref(sec:def-passive-Japanese-passive) outlines the definition
of 'passive' and how passive is expressed in Japanese using V-*te morau*
and V-(*r*)*are* constructions. Section \@ref(sec:passive-difficulty)
reviews experimental results in English, German, and Japanese 
that measured processing difficulties in passives.  Section
\@ref(sec:periphrastic-passive-rationale) justifies the comparison of
V-*te morau* passive and V-*te ageru* active, not V-(*r*)*are* passive
and V-$\emptyset$ active. Section \@ref(sec:expt-benefactive-cq) reports
the methodology and results of our SPR experiment. A discussion follows
in Section \@ref(sec:discussion). 

# Definition of passive diathesis and voice and Japanese passive voices {#sec:def-passive-Japanese-passive}

In this article,  the term 'diathesis' refers to the assignment
of thematic roles to grammatical relations, and the term 'voice' refers
to the verbal marking used to represent a certain diathesis, adopting
Zúñiga and Kittilä's [-@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book] definition. According
to these researchers, 'passive diathesis'   the
diathesis that maps a thematic patient role to a syntactic subject and
demotes the agent role to an optional adjunct or oblique. 'Passive
voice' is defined as a marker on a verb that indicates a passive
diathesis. A marking style is  synthetical if a morpheme is
used to indicate passive; and  it is analytical if passive is
indicated by a construction that combines a non-finite form of a verb to
convey the main lexical content and a functional auxiliary verb
[@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book].  These definitions indicate that
 V-*te morau*  is an analytical passive construction.
   Moreover, these definitions distinguish
passive constructions using V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau*, 
 from other constructions that use the same forms. 
 The following discussion  introduces the passive
voice using V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau* in the passive diathesis,
which is the main focus of the current study. Whilst V-(*r*)*are* and
V-*te morau* voice are employed in non-passive diathesis, they are
beyond the scope of this study. Refer to \@ref(sec:sunucl) for further
details on these usages.

The passive morpheme -(*r*)*are* following a main verb (*home*- 'to
praise') synthetically marks the passive voice, as demonstrated in
(@ref(v-rare)a). A patient (i.e. Mochizuki, the praisee of the praising
event) is expressed by a nominative-marked subject and an agent
(i.e. Kamimura, a praiser) by a dative-marked oblique. 
 The agent is demoted from core argument status in the passive
(@ref(v-rare)a),  compared to in its active counterpart
(@ref(v-rare)b), where the agent is a nominative-marked subject and a
patient is an accusative-marked object.

\end{exe}
```


V-*te morau*, as shown in (@ref(v-te-morau)a), is another passive
construction  according to the above definitions. A main verb
in non-finite form with the converb *-te* and the auxiliary verb *morau*
 compose a verbal chunk and analytically signal passive voice.
Since the auxiliary verb *morau* originates from a receiving verb,
 V-*te morau* can be an example of what @Keenan_Dryer2007
[pp337--338] called a 'periphrastic passive' whose 'passive auxiliary is
a verb of reception'.

V-*te morau* has its active counterpart V-*te ageru*, as shown in
(@ref(v-te-morau)b). Active voice in V-*te ageru* is indicated by a main
verb in non-finite form with the converb *-te* and the auxiliary verb
*ageru*, which originates from a giving verb.

V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau* have similarities in the correspondences
of semantic roles and grammatical function, especially when 1. the main
verb denotes an event where one person acts on the other, such as
praising and supporting events, and 2. the constructions only describe
the event participants that are directly involved in that event
(i.e. only agentive and patientive participants). In both constructions,
the subject is assigned to the patient NP, which denotes an event
participant who does not initiate the event
[@Hayatsu2020_overview; @Hayatsu2020].  For instance, both
addressers of (@ref(v-te-morau)a) and (@ref(v-rare)a) describe the event
from the patient's perspective (i.e. not *who praised whom* but *who was
praised by whom* in the event).  

Despite their similarity, V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau* also differ in
several ways.  The most evident  difference 
is that  only V-*te morau* expresses the assumptions of the
addresser that 1. an event induced by the agent benefits the patient or
undergoer denoted by a sentential subject  and that 2. the
referent owes the same benefit to the agent [@Takami_Kuno2002]. For
instance, an addresser use (@ref(v-te-morau)a), not (@ref(v-rare)a),
when the addresser assumes that the patient of an event (e.g. a praising
event) receives some sort of benefit from the event. 

In typology, the beneficiary in benefactive constructions has been
distinguished from patient,  since beneficiaries are often
coded differently from patients, especially using the oblique.
Furthermore, the beneficiary is usually indirectly affected by the
results of an event while the patient is directly affected
[@Zúñiga_Kittilä2010].   However, in V-*te morau*
constructions whose bivalent main verb denotes a human-to-human action,
as shown in (@ref(v-te-morau)a), the beneficiary in the subject position
is also a patient. The beneficiary in (@ref(v-te-morau)a), Mochizuki, is
directly affected by the praising event, and is marked by nominative
*=ga* in the same way as the patient in (@ref(v-rare)a). 
  



# Are passives more difficult to comprehend than actives? {#sec:passive-difficulty}

## Processing difficulty of passives found in European languages

Paolazzi and colleagues
[-@Paolazzi_etal2016; -@Paolazzi_etal2017; -@Paolazzi_etal2019]
 conducted SPR experiments  in English and argued that
the reading time necessary for the verb and post-verb regions in
passives was shorter than or the same as that which was necessary for
actives. They suggested that the auxiliary verb *be* and the preposition
*by* in the passives contribute to readers' prediction of the
(post-)verb region.  For instance,   the
input of the sentence-initial NP in actives triggers various predictions
about the upcoming elements, as different elements other than a verb can
also follow that NP. Therefore,  this makes it relatively less
likely to predict whether a verb will immediately follow the
sentence-initial NP. Conversely, in passives, the input of the auxiliary
verb *be* makes it more predictable that a verb (in past participle
form) will follow *be*. Thus, Paolazzi et al
[-@Paolazzi_etal2019; -@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL]  claim that
 elements preceding the verb region elevate predictability for
verbs in passives compared to in actives, leading to shorter reading
times for verbs in passives than in actives.  They also argued
that a non-subject NP might be more predictable in passives than in
actives, which  resulted in faster reading times for the
post-verb region in passives, since the combination of a verb and the
preposition *by* in passives signalled a non-subject NP, 
whilst in actives only the verb is available for such a prediction.

@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL also emphasised that the processing difficulties
for passives arises during  comprehension questions in active
voice targeting thematic roles (i.e. questions asking *who* did
something to *whom*). They also argued that processing difficulties for
passives hardly occurs during the  reading process itself.
  Similar results  were also found in German
[@Grillo_etal2019; @Meng_Barder2021].   
@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL also  showed that participants 
responded less accurately to comprehension questions in active voice
asking about thematic relations after they read passive targets.
  

## Previous findings on the processing load for Japanese V-(*r*)*are* passives compared to V-$\emptyset$ actives

Experimental results in Japanese also suggest that passives have a
higher processing load than actives. In particular, several studies have
suggested that passives make sentence comprehension [@Tamaoka_etal2005]
and syntactic processing [@Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017] more
difficult than actives, and that passive verbs put a greater load
 on morphological processing than active verbs
[@Yokoyama_etal2006].

### Behavioural response study using a correct sentence decision task

@Tamaoka_etal2005 presented various constructions ---including actives
and passives in the canonical order (subject-to-non-subject) and
scrambled order (non-subject-to-subject)---to participants and had them
perform a correct sentence decision task, asking them to judge whether
each sentence made sense.    
      Their
results indicate that in both scrambled and canonical conditions, the
reaction times for passives were noticeably longer than for actives,
even though the error rates of both constructions were comparable,
      
  and suggest that human parsers encounter more
processing difficulties with passives than actives.

(ref:cap-Tamaoka-etal2005) The error rate and reaction time in the
making-sense judgement task reported by @Tamaoka_etal2005. Error bars
indicate 95% confidence interval calculated by Masataka Ogawa based on
the originally reported SD and number of participants.

Nonetheless, further evidence  is called for to confirm whether
Japanese passives are in fact more cognitively demanding than actives.
  It is necessary 1. to directly compare actives and
passives, both in accuracy and reading time, and 2. to elaborate the
task to measure the processing load of passives.  Since
@Tamaoka_etal2005 used ungrammatical or implausible sentences for the
targets,   the processing load measured in the task
might only reflect that general syntactico-semantic anomalies 
are less detectable in passives. Therefore, a different experiment is
required to detect the cognitive load specific to passives. 
 

### fMRI studies

@Kinno_etal2008 and @Tanaka_etal2017 conducted a picture-sentence
matching task to capture  the differences in brain activation
 elicited by Japanese V-$\emptyset$ actives and V-(*r*)are
passives, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the
reaction times. In a trial, they showed participants a picture depicting
one of two stick figures  acting on the other (e.g. to push)
along with a written sentence.   Participants were
asked to judge whether the sentence correctly described the picture. The
sentence described the picture either accurately or inaccurately
 by reversing the agent and patient.  
      
They found that passives induced more brain activation  than
actives. This neural activation tendency was statistically significant
in @Kinno_etal2008,   who concluded that this
activation was due to the syntactic reanalysis required to comprehend
that the patient was expressed by a nominative =*ga*-marked NP in
 passives. 

(ref:cap-Kinno-etal2008) The accuracy rate and reaction time in the
picture-sentence matching task by @Kinno_etal2008, where 14 participants
took part in and 6 items were used. Error bars indicate 95% confidence
interval calculated by Masataka Ogawa based on the originally reported
SD and number of participants. AS: active sentence in canonical SOV
order; PS: passive sentence in canonical SOV order; SC: control
condition using ($\bigcirc$*=to* $\square$*=ga* V[intr]{.smallcaps}
'$\bigcirc$ and $\square$ is doing something denoted by the intransitive
verb'); SS: scrambled active sentence in OSV order.

(ref:cap-Yokoyama-etal2006) The accuracy rate and reaction time in the
lexical decision task by @Yokoyama_etal2006, where 30 participants took
part in and 28 items were used. Error bars indicate 95% confidence
interval calculated by Masataka Ogawa based on the originally reported
SD and number of participants.

However, processing difficulty in passive syntactic structures may not
be the only factor that activates the left inferior frontal gyrus.
  @Yokoyama_etal2006 observed a similar activation
pattern in a lexical decision task meant primarily to compare 
the cognitive demands of  uninflected (i.e. morphologically
unmarked) V-$\emptyset$ active verbs and  inflected
(i.e. morphologically marked) V-(*r*)*are* passive verbs in Japanese.
They concluded that the  activation difference reflected that
inflectionally unmarked active verbs are processed as a single word,
 whilst inflectionally marked passive verbs further require
inflectional processing that decomposes them into morphological units.
  Therefore, it remains unclear whether this kind of
 neural activity reflects the cognitive load necessary for the
processing of the diathesis (sentence level; whether a subject or
object/oblique expresses the agent or patient) or the voice (verb chunk
level; the verb form used to express the diathesis).  
     

# At what stage are Japanese passives difficult to understand? {#sec:periphrastic-passive-rationale}

So far,  comprehension studies of Japanese sentence and verbal
morpheme have demonstrated that reaction times to comprehension
questions for V-(*r*)*are* passive sentences and verbs were longer than
for their active counterparts V-$\emptyset$, although the accuracy for
passives had different results in the studies
[@Tamaoka_etal2005; @Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017; @Yokoyama_etal2006].
 One question that remains unsolved is which phrases/parts in
Japanese passives are more difficult for human parsers to comprehend,
compared to their active counterparts.  The current study aims
to detect which parts of passive constructions demand greater cognitive
loads from the human parsing system, by using a moving window self-paced
reading (SPR) task. To minimise the impact of the morphological
differences between active and passive voice found in V-(*r*)*are*
passive and V-$\emptyset$ active, we compare the reading times of V-*te
morau* benefactive passive and V-*te ageru* benefactive active, which
both overtly mark voice using the auxiliary verbs *morau* and *ageru*
respectively.

The current research also aims to determine the extent of the effect of
a voice (mis)match between targets and comprehension questions.
@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL found that a voice (mis)match between target
stimuli and comprehension questions impacted the accuracy in answering
comprehension questions targeting passive stimuli. However, they did not
report the changes in accuracy rate. Thus, our study tries to replicate
a voice mismatch effect in Japanese.

# Experiment: Self-paced reading task with comprehension question {#sec:expt-benefactive-cq}

We conducted an SPR experiment with a moving window paradigm
[@Just_etal1982], followed by a comprehension question task to
investigate whether Japanese V-*te morau* passive has a higher
processing load than its active counterpart, V-*te ageru*. The SPR
experiment specifically examined whether the processing load for
passives becomes higher than that for actives at the verb and post-verb
regions.

## Methods and Designs

### Participants

We recruited 262  native Japanese speakers online using the
Japanese crowdsourcing service CrowdWorks (https://crowdworks.jp/) and
[jikken-baito.com](jikken-baito.com). They gave informed consent and
received ¥600 for their participation in the experiment, which took
about 40 minutes.  They were asked whether they lived in Japan
for the first 13 years of their lives (except for short breaks) and
whether their parents spoke Japanese to them for our assessment of their
language history, as per @Linzen_Oseki2018. We excluded eight
participants who answered no to one or both of the questions or who
reported that they had compulsory education in a non-Japanese language
from our analyses, but not from the paid participation, unlike
@Linzen_Oseki2018.  This was to prevent candidates from making
false declarations in an attempt to participate for the monetary rewards
[@Sprouse_Almeida2012].

### Stimuli

To observe the reading time differences, we manipulate the voice (active
versus passive), by using V-*te ageru* benefactive active or V-*te
morau* benefactive passive as the main verb chunk (R5), as illustrated
in Table \@ref(tab:stimuli-1). A *=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP in
R4 may contribute to the strong prediction of passives in Japanese and
such a prediction may facilitate the reading of passives, if the
*=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP contributes to the prediction and
faster reading time of passives in a similar way to *be* and *by* in
English did [@Paolazzi_etal2019; @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL]. Thus, the
reading time in the verb region (R5) may be shorter in V-*te morau*
benefactive passive preceded by a *=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP
than in V-*te ageru* benefactive active preceded by an
*=o*~[acc]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP.  The processing load
encountered in the verb region (R5) may persist in the subsequent modal
particle region (R6) [Spill-over, @Just_etal1982, pp. 232--233].
Moreover, it may emerge later and be observed as an increase in the
reading time in R6 [delay, @Just_etal1982, p.236]. Therefore, the trend
towards increased reading time would be observed only for verbs (R5),
modal particles (R6), or both.

We used modal particles in R6 to capture the spill-over or delay effect
of the verb region (R5), keeping R5 in a matrix clause rather than in a
subordinate clause, as previous Japanese SPR experiments also utilised
them [@Witzel_Witzel2011; @Koizumi_Imamura2017]. None of these studies
reported that modals affected participants' truth value judgement of
target sentences. In our study, participants would have to answer 'No'
to every trial throughout the experiment, if inferential modals had
influenced on participants' response to comprehension questions.
However, since there were no such participants in our experiment, the
modals possibly did not have an effect. 

To measure the size of facilitatory effect caused by a voice match
between a question and its target, which @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL did not
examine, one of the questions shown in (@ref(comprehension-question))
was used for each V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru* target. To
counterbalance whether 'yes' or 'no' is the correct answer, the order of
NP1 and NP2 in the comprehension questions were same as or reversed from
the target sentence presented in the SPR tasks. This resulted in four
versions of a single question: an active question in NP1 $\to$ NP2 order
whose correct answer is 'yes'  when it appeared after V-*te
ageru* condition of the SPR task,  or whose correct answer is
'no'  when it appeared after V-*te morau* condition of the SPR
task, as shown in (@ref(comprehension-question)a);  an active
question in NP2 $\to$ NP1 order whose correct answer is 'no' when it
appeared after V-*te ageru* condition, or whose correct answer is 'yes'
when it appeared after V-*te morau* condition, as shown in
(@ref(comprehension-question)b); a V-(*r*)*are* passive question in NP1
$\to$ NP2 order whose correct answer is 'yes' when it appeared after
V-*te ageru* condition, or whose correct answer is 'no' when it appeared
after V-*te morau* condition, as shown in
(@ref(comprehension-question)c); a V-(*r*)*are* passive question in NP2
$\to$ NP1 order whose correct answer is 'no' when it appeared after
V-*te ageru* condition, or whose correct answer is 'yes' when it
appeared after V-*te morau* condition, as shown in
(@ref(comprehension-question)d).

Two types of the target sentence (i.e. V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*)
and four versions of the comprehension question as shown in
(@ref(comprehension-question)) resulted in eight conditions in total in
the current experiment, as summarised in Table \@ref(tab:SPR-CQ-stimuli)
in \@ref(sec:stimuli).

All 16 targets and 48 distractors in the main trials and 6 items for the
practice session were grammatically correct.  See
\@ref(sec:stimuli) for all targets.

### Procedure {#sec:expt-cq-procedure}

The experiment was conducted on a website for psycholinguistic
experiments called PennController for Internet Based Experiments
(PCIbex; <https://farm.pcibex.net/>). Participants accessed the site
from their own computers. Any access from the tablets or smartphones was
disabled. 

The participants were told  that one trial consists of an SPR
and comprehension question task with a total of 64 trials, via an
autoplayed video.  Six practice trials were administered to
familiarise participants with the procedure before the main experiment.

In the SPR task, stimuli were presented with the regions hidden by
underscores. As in normal Japanese typesetting, sentences are presented
without spaces between words/regions. Each press of the space bar
displayed one region at a time. The stimuli were presented in black on a
white background using Noto Sans Japanese font.

A comprehension question immediately followed after the participant
finished reading the last region and pressed the space bar. 
The text of the entire question was immediately readable at once.
 Participants pressed the F key to answer 'yes' and the J key
to answer 'no'. No feedback was provided even when the participant
answered incorrectly. We counterbalanced whether 'yes' or 'no' was the
correct answer throughout the targets and distractors, and thus
throughout the experiment.

After responding to the question,  a message appeared asking
participants to press the space bar when they were ready to proceed.
This screen remained visible until the participant pressed the space bar
and started the next trial at their own pace. 

As we counterbalanced the voice of the target sentence (i.e. V-*te
ageru* active versus V-*te morau* passive), the voice of the
comprehension question (i.e. V-$\emptyset$ active versus V-(*r*)*are*
passive), and the correct responses (i.e. whether 'yes' or 'no' was
correct), one of eight lists of stimuli are presented following a
Latin-square design (See Table \@ref(tab:SPR-CQ-stimuli) in
\@ref(sec:stimuli)). 

### Data analysis

#### Data exclusion criteria

Since 55 participants participated or were suspected of participating in
the experiment multiple times, their data were removed from our
analyses. The data from 50 participants were also removed as the stimuli
were not properly presented or were suspected of not being properly
presented to them. Data from 2 participants were removed due to
recording errors on the server. Data from 2 participants with overall
accuracy for distractors is \<75% were removed from the final analysis,
following @Paolazzi_etal2019. Ultimately, the data from 145 participants
were eventually analysed.

In PCIbex, a trial proceeds to the last region with little or no reading
in the middle, if the space key is held down during a trial instead of
pressing it each time a region is read. In such a case, the reading time
of each region tends to be recorded as around 35 ms. 
Therefore, the reading times less than 50 ms were also excluded.


#### Statistical models

We fit Bayesian generalised mixed effect models with by-participants and
by-items correlated varying intercept and varying slopes using `R`
[@R-base]. We used `brms` package [@R-brms] for the model building, with
the backend of `cmdstanr` [@R-cmdstanr] for the coefficient calculation,
and with the backend of `rstan` [@R-rstan] to pass `stanfit` objects to
`bridgesampling` [@R-bridgesampling] for the Bayes factor calculation.
We fit every model using `brms::brm()` with 4 chains and 4 cores in
parallel,  2000 warm-up and 50000 post-warm-up iterations, and
a target mean acceptance probability $\delta = 0.9$ for the NUTS
sampler. 

We calculated the Bayes factors for the alternative over the null model
($\text{BF}_{10}$) to test whether each explanatory variable had a
non-null effect on the response variables.  For instance, to
test the presence of voice effect (i.e. difference in reading time or
accuracy between V-*te morau* versus V-*te ageru*), we compared an
alternative model with the coefficient (parameter) of voice effect
against a null model without that coefficient,  by calculating
a $\text{BF}_{10}$. The $\text{BF}_{10}$ for voice effect larger than
one indicates that the difference in voice affects the reading time or
accuracy. On the other hand, the $\text{BF}_{10}$ less than one means
that there is no effect of voice on the reading time or accuracy. Lee
and Wagenmakers' criteria [-@BCM2013, derived from Jeffreys,
]  was used to determine the
strength of the evidence for alternative models or null models:

        Moderate evidence



```{=latex}
%\renewcommand{\labelitemii}{}
\renewcommand{\labelitemii}{\normalfont\bfseries \textendash}
```
 Since the priors of both the explanatory variables
and intercept may radically affect the computation of Bayes factors [See
Section 15.3 of @PL-BDA2021], we calibrated those priors using prior
predictive checks following @Schad_etal2020 and @Schad_etal2022.
 To track changes in the values of coefficient and
$\text{BF}_{10}$ depending on priors, we calculated $\text{BF}_{10}$
multiple times for each explanatory variable using normally-distributed
priors with a mean of zero, but with different SDs, adapting the
procedure of @Nicenboim_etal2020.

##### Reading time data {#sec:cq-reading-time}

Reading time was assumed to be log-normally distributed. The explanatory
variables of interest, namely voice of the target, was sum-coded, with
V-*te morau* benefactive passive coded as $1$ and V-*te ageru*
benefactive passive coded as $-1$. The number of characters in the
region and the absolute trial order were also added to the models as
covariates. The absolute trial order is the order in which one target is
presented among all stimuli including distractors. Both the number of
characters in the region and the trial order are $z$-transformed,
following @PL-BDA2021 [Section 9.2]. Since the number of characters
differed by condition of voice (i.e. the between-item factor), there was
no random slope of items for the factor.

According to prior predictive checks, we used normally-distributed
priors for target voice with varying SD of 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.075, 0.05,
0.025, 0.01, 0.0075, 0.005, 0.0025, and 0.001.  For other
parameters, we used the priors summarised in Table
\@ref(tab:priors-reading-time).

##### Accuracy of comprehension questions

We fit mixed effects logistic regressions to the accuracy data. The
voice of the target was sum-coded, with V-*te morau* benefactive passive
coded as $-1$ and V-*te ageru* benefactive passive coded as $1$. The NP
order in comprehension questions was also sum-coded, with NP1 $\to$ NP2
(the same as the target) coded as $1$ and NP2 $\to$ NP1 (reversed from
the target) coded as $-1$. The voice (mis)match effect  was
coded using a nested sum contrast [@Schad_etal2020_contrasts], so that 1
is assigned if voice matches between target and question, as summarised
in Table \@ref(tab:nested-sum-contrast). The $z$-transformed absolute
trial order was also added to the models as a covariate.

According to prior predictive checks, we used normally-distributed
priors for target voice with varying SD of 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, and 0.05. We
used $\text{N}(1.3, 0.2)$ priors for intercepts, $\text{N}(0, 0.1)$
priors for the slopes, and LKJ priors with $\eta = 2$ for the
correlation matrices.

## Predictions

### Predictions for the reading time

As argued by @Paolazzi_etal2019 and @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL, the shorter
reading times for passives than for actives were attributed to
differences in the predictability of upcoming words/phrases based on
antecedents between passives and actives. In Japanese, a dative *=ni*
marked NP may signal that the sentence is passive, and an accusative
*=o* marked NP may signal that the sentence is active. Thus, if parsers
of native Japanese speakers are actively predicting the upcoming
elements based on antecedents, reading time differences between
conditions can occur in    the verb (R5) and
the modal immediately following the verb (R6), as shown in Table
\@ref(tab:stimuli-1).

Meanwhile, a *=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP may not be sufficient to
predict that a passive verb follows,  and  the
facilitatory effect for passives may not occur. In this case, 
the reading time would be longer in V-*te morau* passives than in V-*te
ageru* actives. Since both active voice and passive voice were
analytically marked using auxiliary verbs in this experiment, the longer
reading time for passives can be attributed more to the processing load
needed to resolve the mapping of the thematic roles and grammatical
functions (i.e. diathesis processing) than morphological inflection in
the passive verb [as found by @Yokoyama_etal2006]. A spill-over and/or
delay of the processing load encountered in the verb region (R5) may
also occur, resulting in longer reading times in passives for verbs
(R5), for modal particles immediately following verbs (R6), or for both
regions.

### Predictions for the comprehension question tasks

@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL [Experiment 3] found that if both active and
passive were used in the questions about thematic relations (i.e. who
did something to whom), the difference in accuracy between actives and
passives was neutralised, as the question and its target sentence
matched by being  in the passive voice and caused a
facilitatory priming effect in favour of passive targets. 
 Thus, a facilitatory effect caused by the voice match between
the question and its target is also expected in Japanese.

## Results

### Reading time data {#reading-time-data}

As illustrated in Table \@ref(tab:tab-reading-time) (and Figure
\@ref(fig:fig-ben-read-time-R1-R6) in
\@ref(sec:reading-time-all-regions)), the median and mean reading time
for V-*te morau* benefactive passive was longer than V-*te ageru*
benefactive active in both verb (R5) and modal (R6) region. However,
Bayes factors moderately favoured the alternative models and the
presence of the effect of target voice only when the prior SDs were very
constrained (i.e. $\text{SD} \leq 0.1$ for R5 and $\text{SD} \leq 0.025$
for R6) and thus yielded tiny estimates of the coefficient for the
target voice, as demonstrated in Figure
\@ref(fig:fig-R5-R6-table-fixef-voice). Furthermore, Bayes factors
favoured the null models and the absence of the effect of the target
voice when the prior SD was less constrained and thus yielded stable
estimates of the coefficient for the target voice. This means that the
voice contrast between V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru* had little impact
on reading times.

```
### Accuracy of comprehension questions

As Figure \@ref(fig:fig-accuracy-facet-cq-NP-order) illustrates,
accuracy was lower for V-*te morau* passive targets than V-*te ageru*
active targets. This is supported by strong evidence of $\text{BF}_{10}$
as prior SD increases, as shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:fig-accuracy-table-fixef). Accuracy was lower for
comprehension question whose NP order was NP1 $\to$ NP2 than for those
whose NP order was NP2 $\to$ NP1, supported by strong evidence of
$\text{BF}_{10}$. Moreover, when comprehension questions had NP1 $\to$
NP2 order, matching the voice between target sentences and their
comprehension questions drastically increased the accuracy, both in
V-*te ageru* actives and V-*te morau* passives. These voice matching
effects were corroborated by the extreme evidence of $\text{BF}_{10}$.
However, such voice matching effects were not supported in either V-*te
ageru* actives or V-*te morau* passives with low $\text{BF}_{10}$ when
comprehension questions had a NP2 $\to$ NP1 order.

# General discussion and conclusion {#sec:discussion}

## Comparable reading time difference between V-*te morau* benefactive passive and V-*te ageru* benefactive active

In the raw data, reading times for *V-te morau* passives were longer
than *V-te ageru* actives. The current results differ from the results
in English [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019]
and in German [@Grillo_etal2019] showing that passives have numerically
shorter reading times than actives. However,  Bayes factors did
not clearly support either the presence or absence of the effect of
voice on reading time difference. These findings contradict to the
prediction derived from the previous research in SVO languages that the
elements prior to the verb region (e.g. a *=ni*[dat]{.smallcaps}-marked
NP in R4 in this experiment) may signal that the subsequent region and
entire sentence is passive, leading to shorter reading times for passive
compared to actives. Possible reasons for the lack of reading time
differences could be due to sentence processing specific to V-*te morau*
and V-*te ageru*. 

Both V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru* overtly mark passive and active voice
respectively, and they both analytically express voice in a similar
morphological composition.  Therefore, it is possible that the
same processing load and time were required for the actives as the
passives.  In contrast, in the pair of V-$\emptyset$ active and
V-(*r*)*are* passive, as well as in the pair of English active and *be*
passive (*be* V.[pst.ptcp]{.smallcaps}),  only the passive has
a morphosyntactically complex marker.  Thus, only passives may
tend to be more cognitively demanding, and this might have resulted in
the clearer difference between active and passive in previous research.
The manifestation of the processing load may differ when comparing the
pair of V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*,  and when comparing the
pair V-(*r*)*are* passive and V-$\emptyset$ active, and the comparison
of the former may not be measured by the reading times in this study.
  Therefore, further research that examines other
behavioural measurements is necessary. In experiments comparing the
processing of V-(*r*)*are* passive and V-$\emptyset$ active, both
morphological processing [Lexical decision task by @Yokoyama_etal2006]
and processing involving syntax [picture-sentence matching task by
@Kinno_etal2008; and @Tanaka_etal2017] showed activation of the left
inferior frontal gyrus for V-(*r*)*are* passive. However, this alone
does not tell us whether the left inferior frontal gyrus is more
strongly activated by morphological processing (the internal process to
form a verb base phrase/verb chunk) or syntactic processing (the whole
VP/sentence level). It is not possible to determine whether the
processing of the diathesis  or the voice  is more
difficult. It is only with V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*, which have a
similar morphological processing, that it is possible to clarify the
differences in brain activation on syntactic processing in the active
and passive voice, after matching the morphological processing as much
as possible.

## Accuracy

In general, accuracy in the comprehension questions targeting V-*te
morau* passive was lower than those targeting V-*te ageru* active. Since
V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru* share a similar morphological composition,
syntactic factors---namely, the mapping of patient to grammatical
subject in passives---are more likely to induce this accuracy difference
than morphological factors. Moreover, the accuracy in comprehension
questions targeting V-*te morau* passives was significantly improved by
questions in V-(*r*)*are* passives, compared to those in actives. This
replicates what @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL found in thier study of English
passives, and suggests that V-*te morau* primes V-(*r*)*are*,
facilitating the processing of V-(*r*)*are* and alleviating the
cognitive load required to maintain and retrieve the representation of
V-*te morau*. This priming further implies that the patientive
beneficiaries in V-*te morau* benefactive passive and normal patients in
V-(*r*)*are* passive could be represented and processed as one broad
patientive macrorole in the native speakers' parser. 

Interestingly, accuracy for comprehension questions targeting V-*te
ageru* active sharply decreased when the questions were in V-(*r*)*are*
passive causing a voice mismatch.  This indicates that
V-(*r*)*are* passive intervened post-interpretive process
[i.e. memorising the contents of a sentence and using them to do other
action, @Caplan_Waters1999], such as responding comprehension questions
in our experiment, for V-*te ageru* active.   Unlike
what has previously been considered, both passive and active 
diathesis can possibly be prone to diathesis mismatch between the target
and the question.

Moreover, a facilitating priming effect from V-*te morau* to
V-(*r*)*are* was elicitable only when a V-*te morau* target and its
question using V-(*r*)*are* have a same NP order (i.e. NP1 $\to$ NP2
order both in the targets and comprehension questions). 


# Conclusion and limitations {#sec:conclusion}

The Japanese analytical benefactive passive, V-*te morau*, is indeed
more difficult to comprehend than its active counterpart V-*te ageru*,
which was evident in accuracy in the comprehension questions, not
reading times.   In our experiment, we aligned the
morphological features of passive and active voices. Consequently, it is
unsurprising that the reading time for passive sentences did not
decrease compared to the active ones. This contrasts with earlier
findings in English
[@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019] and German
[@Grillo_etal2019].

Previous studies suggested that the verb region is read faster in
passive constructions due to the stronger morphological signals
indicating passivisation (e.g. copula verbs and PPs denoting the agent).
In the current study, there existed a morphological signal in passive
sentences in R3 (the second NP), specifically the agentive NP marked by
the dative *=ni*, which differed from the patientive NP marked by the
accusative *=o* in actives within the same region. Nonetheless, we found
no reduction in reading times for the subsequent verb (R5) and modal
particle (R6) regions in passives.

Hence, the morphological cues that facilitate passive reading, as
reported in prior studies, might have limited impact in Japanese
passives. Future work will address this possibility by comparing reading
times between V-(*r*)*are* passives and V-$\emptyset$ actives.

Alternatively, this effect might be unobservable in experiments that
control the morphological factors between passives and actives. For a
more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon, future research
should replicate our results using languages in which pairs of
passive-active constructions demonstrate an equipollent alternation,
such as Finnish, Kafa, and Sinhala [@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book], akin to
Japanese *V-te morau* and *V-te ageru*. Considering the relative
scarcity of this alternation pattern from a typological perspective
[@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book], such an approach would also contribute to a
in-depth cross-linguistic validation in psycholinguistics. 
 

Furthermore, the improvement in accuracy for comprehension questions
targeting V-*te morau* sentences with V-(*r*)*are* questions gave a new
insight on the range of the patientive macrorole. This results suggests
that patientive beneficiaries in V-*te morau* benefactive passive and
normal patients in V-(*r*)*are* passive could be categorised under a
unified patientive macrorole within the cognitive process of native
speakers' parser.

However, the generalisability of this result may be subject to certain
limitations. One such constraint is that the priming effect became
apparent only when both a V-*te morau* target and its corresponding
V-(*r*)*are* question maintained identical NP order. Consequently, one
might raise a question regarding whether the observed facilitating
priming effect from V-*te morau* to V-(*r*)*are* is attributable to the
circumstance in which the NP denoting a non-agentive semantic role
emerges as the syntactic subject in both constructions.

Nevertheless, the increase in accuracy observed when the questions
targeting V-*te morau* were formulated as V-(*r*)*are* would not have
occurred if these semantic roles were considered entirely distinct
entities. Any such distinction would have resulted in interference
between these two passive constructions, leading to a decrease in
accuracy despite the same word order between the two consturctions.
Future research will explore whether the current findings are rooted in
the primability between the beneficiary of V-*te morau* and the patient
of V-(*r*)*are*, by comparing the primability of these roles, as well as
the primability between the beneficiary and a role that falls outside
both the agentive and patientive macroroles, or between the patient and
such a role.
