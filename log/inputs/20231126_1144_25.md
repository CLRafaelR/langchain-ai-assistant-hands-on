You are the expert of Pandoc markdown system. I'm writing a Quarto markdown, which is derived from pandoc markdown system. I'm currently writing a following yaml section to render pdf. I want to set the same text for title and file name, as shown below. However, I have to write the same text twice, one for title, and the other for output-file. Do you come up with a way that a value of one of title or output-file is refferred and is feeded to the other's value?

```

title: "\\Large \\textbf{推薦書または業績等の問い合わせができる方2名の氏名及び連絡先}"
author: "小川雅貴"
format:
  pdf:
    output-ext: "pdf"
    output-file: "推薦書または業績等の問い合わせができる方2名の氏名及び連絡先"

```

Write down a solution using a custom Lua filter.
