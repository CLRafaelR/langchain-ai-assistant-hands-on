Your first lua filter is more feasible than the second. In the first lua filter you created that I repost as follows, the `meta['output-file']` will receive `filename` value, won't it? This might be wrong, since `output-file` key is under `format: pdf` in the YAML section.

```
-- file: set-output-file.lua
function Meta(meta)
  if meta.title then
    -- Remove LaTeX commands and special characters to create a valid filename
    local filename = pandoc.utils.stringify(meta.title)
    filename = filename:gsub("\\%a+", ""):gsub("[^%w%s]", ""):gsub("%s+", "_")
    meta['output-file'] = filename
  end
  return meta
end
```

How do you think what I pointed out here? Do you have to rewrite the code above?
