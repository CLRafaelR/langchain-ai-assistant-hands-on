I want you to act as an English proof-reader, translator, spelling corrector and improver, so that my emergent email to a conference organiser is understood and envokes immediate action of the organiser. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in British English. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with clearer, more understandable, more concise, and upper level English words and sentences. Keep the meaning same, but make them more concise, formal and official. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. Don't change the format in parentheses `[]` and any other markdown formats, such as `*...*`. My sentences are as follows:

Dear Professor Dr. Emmanuele Chersoni,

I am Masataka Ogawa, the author of submission No. 40. 無事香港に到着し，I received the QR codes for campus access, too. However, 本日12月2日のparallel session 1aが開催される建物名・階数・部屋の名前などが分かりません。本日最初の発表者ですので，大学内の施設名称を教えていただけると非常に助かります。

お返事お待ちしております。

カルロス
