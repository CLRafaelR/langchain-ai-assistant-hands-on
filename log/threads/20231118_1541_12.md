## Requirements

### Formats

1. Prefix each slide's title with `##`, followed by an empty line preceding the body text.
2. Ensure slide titles accurately encapsulate the essence of your paper's content.
3. Include a minimum of three and a maximum of five key points per slide to thoroughly yet succinctly convey the information.
4. Where necessary, provide two or three supplementary explanations for each key point to elucidate further. You have to update the explanation of a key point itself, rather than adding just one supplementary explanation to a key point, if you only come up with just one supplementary explanation. By following this, there must be two or three supplementary explanations per key point, where such supplementary explanations are required to clearly understand why and how much the key point is important to the psycholinguistic literature.

### Contents

#### Based on the paper

The key points and supplementary explanations must be derived exclusively from the original paper's content. Refrain from incorporating unsolicited suggestions, personal interpretations, or speculative comments that are not present in the paper. Failure to authentically represent the paper's content will result in accusations of plagiarism and could permanently tarnish your academic publishing credentials. Ensure that your presentation strictly reflects the original paper.

#### State key points clearly and effectively use their supplementary expectations

For example, it is unacceptable to mention "challenge to the previous research" as a key point without supplementary explanation detailing how this research contrasts with prior studies. Instead, specify "challenge to the previous research on `<number>` points" and then clearly articulate these points through the corresponding number of supplementary explanations.
If you only come up with just one supplementary explanation, you have to directly merge the explanation of a key point and its supplementary explanation as if they were one key point, rather than separating a key point and just one supplementary explanation to the key point.

#### Focus on the Main Topic

- Do not create an acknowledgements slide.
- Do not create an abbreviations or acronyms slide.

#### Explain the original paper in detail

The following paper has a discussion in Section (`\@ref(sec:discussion)`). You must explain how the current reading time and accuracy of Japanese benefactive passives elucidate the cognitive process of understanding passive constructions. You have also to mention limitations that are stated in `Conclusion and limitations` in the original paper. Use five slides in total.

# General discussion and conclusion {#sec:discussion}

## Comparable reading time difference between V-*te morau* benefactive passive and V-*te ageru* benefactive active

In the raw data, reading times for *V-te morau* passives were longer than *V-te ageru* actives. The current results differ from the results in English [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019] and in German [@Grillo_etal2019] showing that passives have numerically shorter reading times than actives. However, Bayes factors did not clearly support either the presence or absence of the effect of voice on reading time difference. These findings contradict to the prediction derived from the previous research in SVO languages that the elements prior to the verb region (e.g. a *=ni*[dat]{.smallcaps}-marked NP in R4 in this experiment) may signal that the subsequent region and entire sentence is passive, leading to shorter reading times for passive compared to actives. Possible reasons for the lack of reading time differences could be due to sentence processing specific to V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*. 

Both V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru* overtly mark passive and active voice respectively, and they both analytically express voice in a similar morphological composition. Therefore, it is possible that the same processing load and time were required for the actives as the passives. In contrast, in the pair of V-$\emptyset$ active and V-(*r*)*are* passive, as well as in the pair of English active and *be* passive (*be* V.[pst.ptcp]{.smallcaps}), only the passive has a morphosyntactically complex marker. Thus, only passives may tend to be more cognitively demanding, and this might have resulted in the clearer difference between active and passive in previous research. The manifestation of the processing load may differ when comparing the pair of V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*, and when comparing the pair V-(*r*)*are* passive and V-$\emptyset$ active, and the comparison of the former may not be measured by the reading times in this study. Therefore, further research that examines other behavioural measurements is necessary. In experiments comparing the processing of V-(*r*)*are* passive and V-$\emptyset$ active, both morphological processing [Lexical decision task by @Yokoyama_etal2006] and processing involving syntax [picture-sentence matching task by @Kinno_etal2008; and @Tanaka_etal2017] showed activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus for V-(*r*)*are* passive. However, this alone does not tell us whether the left inferior frontal gyrus is more strongly activated by morphological processing (the internal process to form a verb base phrase/verb chunk) or syntactic processing (the whole VP/sentence level). It is not possible to determine whether the processing of the diathesis or the voice is more difficult. It is only with V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*, which have a similar morphological processing, that it is possible to clarify the differences in brain activation on syntactic processing in the active and passive voice, after matching the morphological processing as much as possible.

## Accuracy

In general, accuracy in the comprehension questions targeting V-*te morau* passive was lower than those targeting V-*te ageru* active. Since V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru* share a similar morphological composition, syntactic factors---namely, the mapping of patient to grammatical subject in passives---are more likely to induce this accuracy difference than morphological factors. Moreover, the accuracy in comprehension questions targeting V-*te morau* passives was significantly improved by questions in V-(*r*)*are* passives, compared to those in actives. This replicates what @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL found in thier study of English passives, and suggests that V-*te morau* primes V-(*r*)*are*, facilitating the processing of V-(*r*)*are* and alleviating the cognitive load required to maintain and retrieve the representation of V-*te morau*. This priming further implies that the patientive beneficiaries in V-*te morau* benefactive passive and normal patients in V-(*r*)*are* passive could be represented and processed as one broad patientive macrorole in the native speakers' parser. 

Interestingly, accuracy for comprehension questions targeting V-*te ageru* active sharply decreased when the questions were in V-(*r*)*are* passive causing a voice mismatch. This indicates that V-(*r*)*are* passive intervened post-interpretive process [i.e. memorising the contents of a sentence and using them to do other action, @Caplan_Waters1999], such as responding comprehension questions in our experiment, for V-*te ageru* active. Unlike what has previously been considered, both passive and active diathesis can possibly be prone to diathesis mismatch between the target and the question.

Moreover, a facilitating priming effect from V-*te morau* to V-(*r*)*are* was elicitable only when a V-*te morau* target and its question using V-(*r*)*are* have a same NP order (i.e. NP1 $\to$ NP2 order both in the targets and comprehension questions). 


# Conclusion and limitations {#sec:conclusion}

The Japanese analytical benefactive passive, V-*te morau*, is indeed more difficult to comprehend than its active counterpart V-*te ageru*, which was evident in accuracy in the comprehension questions, not reading times. In our experiment, we aligned the morphological features of passive and active voices. Consequently, it is unsurprising that the reading time for passive sentences did not decrease compared to the active ones. This contrasts with earlier findings in English [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019] and German [@Grillo_etal2019].

Previous studies suggested that the verb region is read faster in passive constructions due to the stronger morphological signals indicating passivisation (e.g. copula verbs and PPs denoting the agent). In the current study, there existed a morphological signal in passive sentences in R3 (the second NP), specifically the agentive NP marked by the dative *=ni*, which differed from the patientive NP marked by the accusative *=o* in actives within the same region. Nonetheless, we found no reduction in reading times for the subsequent verb (R5) and modal particle (R6) regions in passives.

Hence, the morphological cues that facilitate passive reading, as reported in prior studies, might have limited impact in Japanese passives. Future work will address this possibility by comparing reading times between V-(*r*)*are* passives and V-$\emptyset$ actives.

Alternatively, this effect might be unobservable in experiments that control the morphological factors between passives and actives. For a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon, future research should replicate our results using languages in which pairs of passive-active constructions demonstrate an equipollent alternation, such as Finnish, Kafa, and Sinhala [@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book], akin to Japanese *V-te morau* and *V-te ageru*. Considering the relative scarcity of this alternation pattern from a typological perspective [@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book], such an approach would also contribute to a in-depth cross-linguistic validation in psycholinguistics.   

Furthermore, the improvement in accuracy for comprehension questions targeting V-*te morau* sentences with V-(*r*)*are* questions gave a new insight on the range of the patientive macrorole. This results suggests that patientive beneficiaries in V-*te morau* benefactive passive and normal patients in V-(*r*)*are* passive could be categorised under a unified patientive macrorole within the cognitive process of native speakers' parser.

However, the generalisability of this result may be subject to certain limitations. One such constraint is that the priming effect became apparent only when both a V-*te morau* target and its corresponding V-(*r*)*are* question maintained identical NP order. Consequently, one might raise a question regarding whether the observed facilitating priming effect from V-*te morau* to V-(*r*)*are* is attributable to the circumstance in which the NP denoting a non-agentive semantic role emerges as the syntactic subject in both constructions.

Nevertheless, the increase in accuracy observed when the questions targeting V-*te morau* were formulated as V-(*r*)*are* would not have occurred if these semantic roles were considered entirely distinct entities. Any such distinction would have resulted in interference between these two passive constructions, leading to a decrease in accuracy despite the same word order between the two consturctions. Future research will explore whether the current findings are rooted in the primability between the beneficiary of V-*te morau* and the patient of V-(*r*)*are*, by comparing the primability of these roles, as well as the primability between the beneficiary and a role that falls outside both the agentive and patientive macroroles, or between the patient and such a role.
