# ユーザープロンプト

LLM models have a name typically described as follows, which mean <model supplier>/<model name>. How would you print <model name> only?

```
model_names = [
    "stabilityai/japanese-stablelm-3b-4e1t-instruct",
]
```


# LLMの出力結果

```
model_names = [
    "stabilityai/japanese-stablelm-3b-4e1t-instruct",
]

# モデル名のみを抽出して表示
for full_name in model_names:
    model_name = full_name.split('/')[1]
    print(model_name)
```
