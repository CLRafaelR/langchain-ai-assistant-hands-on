Take a deep breath. You can do this. Write only the slides in markdown format and avoid writing disclaimer, greetings, or any comments such as `Based on the provided content and guidelines, here is a structured set of Markdown slides for the presentation`, `Please note that the above slides...`. Let's think step by step.

# LLMの出力結果

## Slide 1: Introduction to Japanese Passive Constructions

- Complexity of passive voice in Japanese linguistics
  - V-*te morau* and V-(*r*)*are* as distinct forms
  - Influence on sentence comprehension and cognitive load
- Cross-linguistic comparison of passive construction processing
  - Varied difficulty levels across languages
  - Need for direct comparison in reading times and comprehension

## Slide 2: Defining Passive Diathesis and Voice

- Passive diathesis: Thematic patient role as syntactic subject
  - Agent role demotion to adjunct or oblique
- Passive voice: Verbal marking indicating passive diathesis
  - Synthetic vs. analytical marking in Japanese

## Slide 3: Japanese Passive Constructions

- V-(*r*)*are* passive: Synthetic marking with -(*r*)*are* morpheme
  - Example: Mochizuki=ga Kamimura=ni home-*rare*-ta
- V-*te morau* passive: Analytical marking with *morau* auxiliary
  - Example: Mochizuki=ga Kamimura=ni home-*te morat*-ta

## Slide 4: Processing Difficulty in Passives

- Reading times in English and German passives
  - Studies by [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019] and [@Grillo_etal2019]
- Japanese passives and processing load
  - Tamaoka et al.'s findings on sentence comprehension [@Tamaoka_etal2005]
  - Kinno et al.'s fMRI studies on syntactic processing [@Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017]

## Slide 5: Japanese Passives and Cognitive Load

- Self-paced reading (SPR) tasks to identify processing challenges
- Comparison of V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru* to minimize morphological complexity
- Exploring diathesis processing in Japanese passives

## Slide 6: Experiment Methodology

- Participant recruitment and language history assessment
- Stimuli manipulation: Voice (active vs. passive)
- SPR experiment procedure on PCIbex platform

## Slide 7: Reading Time Results

- Reading time comparison between V-*te morau* passive and V-*te ageru* active
- Bayesian statistical models to interpret reading time data

## Slide 8: Comprehension Question Accuracy

- Accuracy rates for comprehension questions targeting passives vs. actives
- Priming effect of V-*te morau* on V-(*r*)*are* and its implications

## Slide 9: Discussion of Findings

- Reading time differences and their implications for cognitive processing
- Accuracy improvement through voice matching in comprehension questions
- Future research directions and limitations

## Slide 10: Conclusion

- Summary of cognitive load findings in Japanese passives
- Contributions to psycholinguistic literature and linguistic typology
- Proposals for future cross-linguistic comparison studies
