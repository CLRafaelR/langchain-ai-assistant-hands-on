# ユーザープロンプト

As an esteemed psycholinguist, you have a track record of delivering exceptional papers and attracting significant audiences at conferences. Your presentations are designed to be accessible to students new to linguistics and those unfamiliar with psychological experiments, cognitive science, and Bayesian statistics, blending technical terms with plain language for clarity. Additionally, you structure your arguments to satisfy expert linguists, addressing intricate and highly specialised subjects.

In two weeks, you are scheduled to give a 20-minute presentation on your latest paper. You are preparing slides that will be rendered from Markdown, planning to dedicate about one minute to each slide, for a total of approximately 20 slides.

The following guidelines must be adhered to when composing your Markdown slides:

""""""

## Requirements

### Formats

1. Prefix each slide's title with `##`, followed by an empty line preceding the body text.
2. Ensure slide titles accurately encapsulate the essence of your paper's content.
3. Include a minimum of three and a maximum of five key points per slide to thoroughly yet succinctly convey the information.
4. Where necessary, provide two or three supplementary explanations for each key point to elucidate further. You have to update the explanation of a key point itself, rather than adding just one supplementary explanation to a key point, if you only come up with just one supplementary explanation. By following this, there must be two or three supplementary explanations per key point, where such supplementary explanations are required to clearly understand why and how much the key point is important to the psycholinguistic literature.

### Contents

#### Based on the paper

The key points and supplementary explanations must be derived exclusively from the original paper's content. Refrain from incorporating unsolicited suggestions, personal interpretations, or speculative comments that are not present in the paper. Failure to authentically represent the paper's content will result in accusations of plagiarism and could permanently tarnish your academic publishing credentials. Ensure that your presentation strictly reflects the original paper.

#### State key points clearly and effectively use their supplementary expectations

For example, it is unacceptable to mention "challenge to the previous research" as a key point without supplementary explanation detailing how this research contrasts with prior studies. Instead, specify "challenge to the previous research on `<number>` points" and then clearly articulate these points through the corresponding number of supplementary explanations.
If you only come up with just one supplementary explanation, you have to rewrite the explanation of a key point itself, rather than adding just one supplementary explanation to a key point, to make the key point is more concrete than before.

#### Focus on the Main Topic

- Do not create an acknowledgements slide.
- Do not create an abbreviations or acronyms slide.

#### Explain the original paper in detail

In the following paper, Section `Experiment: Self-paced reading task with comprehension question` (`\@ref(sec:expt-benefactive-cq)`) reports the methodology and results of our SPR experiment. There must be numerous audience who do have any idea of the methodology of reading time measurement and comprehension question, and statistics that rationale your arguments in the conference. Therefore, you have to explain the method and results in detail step by step, so that the audience can understand the prediction of experiments, how you conducted experiments and how your results can be interpreted. Use ten slides to achieve this.

## Original paper

"""
# Experiment: Self-paced reading task with comprehension question {#sec:expt-benefactive-cq}

We conducted an SPR experiment with a moving window paradigm [@Just_etal1982], followed by a comprehension question task to investigate whether Japanese V-*te morau* passive has a higher processing load than its active counterpart, V-*te ageru*. The SPR experiment specifically examined whether the processing load for passives becomes higher than that for actives at the verb and post-verb regions.

## Methods and Designs

### Participants

We recruited 262  native Japanese speakers online using the Japanese crowdsourcing service CrowdWorks (https://crowdworks.jp/) and [jikken-baito.com](jikken-baito.com). They gave informed consent and received ¥600 for their participation in the experiment, which took about 40 minutes. They were asked whether they lived in Japan for the first 13 years of their lives (except for short breaks) and whether their parents spoke Japanese to them for our assessment of their language history, as per @Linzen_Oseki2018. We excluded eight participants who answered no to one or both of the questions or who reported that they had compulsory education in a non-Japanese language from our analyses, but not from the paid participation, unlike @Linzen_Oseki2018. This was to prevent candidates from making false declarations in an attempt to participate for the monetary rewards [@Sprouse_Almeida2012].

### Stimuli

To observe the reading time differences, we manipulate the voice (active versus passive), by using V-*te ageru* benefactive active or V-*te morau* benefactive passive as the main verb chunk (R5), as illustrated in Table \@ref(tab:stimuli-1). A *=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP in R4 may contribute to the strong prediction of passives in Japanese and such a prediction may facilitate the reading of passives, if the *=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP contributes to the prediction and faster reading time of passives in a similar way to *be* and *by* in English did [@Paolazzi_etal2019; @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL]. Thus, the reading time in the verb region (R5) may be shorter in V-*te morau* benefactive passive preceded by a *=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP than in V-*te ageru* benefactive active preceded by an *=o*~[acc]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP. The processing load encountered in the verb region (R5) may persist in the subsequent modal particle region (R6) [Spill-over, @Just_etal1982, pp. 232--233]. Moreover, it may emerge later and be observed as an increase in the reading time in R6 [delay, @Just_etal1982, p.236]. Therefore, the trend towards increased reading time would be observed only for verbs (R5), modal particles (R6), or both.

We used modal particles in R6 to capture the spill-over or delay effect of the verb region (R5), keeping R5 in a matrix clause rather than in a subordinate clause, as previous Japanese SPR experiments also utilised them [@Witzel_Witzel2011; @Koizumi_Imamura2017]. None of these studies reported that modals affected participants' truth value judgement of target sentences. In our study, participants would have to answer 'No' to every trial throughout the experiment, if inferential modals had influenced on participants' response to comprehension questions. However, since there were no such participants in our experiment, the modals possibly did not have an effect. 

To measure the size of facilitatory effect caused by a voice match between a question and its target, which @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL did not examine, one of the questions shown in (@ref(comprehension-question)) was used for each V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru* target. To counterbalance whether 'yes' or 'no' is the correct answer, the order of NP1 and NP2 in the comprehension questions were same as or reversed from the target sentence presented in the SPR tasks. This resulted in four versions of a single question: an active question in NP1 $\to$ NP2 order whose correct answer is 'yes'  when it appeared after V-*te ageru* condition of the SPR task, or whose correct answer is 'no'  when it appeared after V-*te morau* condition of the SPR task, as shown in (@ref(comprehension-question)a); an active question in NP2 $\to$ NP1 order whose correct answer is 'no' when it appeared after V-*te ageru* condition, or whose correct answer is 'yes' when it appeared after V-*te morau* condition, as shown in (@ref(comprehension-question)b); a V-(*r*)*are* passive question in NP1 $\to$ NP2 order whose correct answer is 'yes' when it appeared after V-*te ageru* condition, or whose correct answer is 'no' when it appeared after V-*te morau* condition, as shown in (@ref(comprehension-question)c); a V-(*r*)*are* passive question in NP2 $\to$ NP1 order whose correct answer is 'no' when it appeared after V-*te ageru* condition, or whose correct answer is 'yes' when it appeared after V-*te morau* condition, as shown in (@ref(comprehension-question)d).

Two types of the target sentence (i.e. V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru*) and four versions of the comprehension question as shown in (@ref(comprehension-question)) resulted in eight conditions in total in the current experiment, as summarised in Table \@ref(tab:SPR-CQ-stimuli) in \@ref(sec:stimuli).

All 16 targets and 48 distractors in the main trials and 6 items for the practice session were grammatically correct. See \@ref(sec:stimuli) for all targets.

### Procedure {#sec:expt-cq-procedure}

The experiment was conducted on a website for psycholinguistic experiments called PennController for Internet Based Experiments (PCIbex; <https://farm.pcibex.net/>). Participants accessed the site from their own computers. Any access from the tablets or smartphones was disabled. 

The participants were told that one trial consists of an SPR and comprehension question task with a total of 64 trials, via an autoplayed video. Six practice trials were administered to familiarise participants with the procedure before the main experiment.

In the SPR task, stimuli were presented with the regions hidden by underscores. As in normal Japanese typesetting, sentences are presented without spaces between words/regions. Each press of the space bar displayed one region at a time. The stimuli were presented in black on a white background using Noto Sans Japanese font.

A comprehension question immediately followed after the participant finished reading the last region and pressed the space bar. The text of the entire question was immediately readable at once. Participants pressed the F key to answer 'yes' and the J key to answer 'no'. No feedback was provided even when the participant answered incorrectly. We counterbalanced whether 'yes' or 'no' was the correct answer throughout the targets and distractors, and thus throughout the experiment.

After responding to the question, a message appeared asking participants to press the space bar when they were ready to proceed. This screen remained visible until the participant pressed the space bar and started the next trial at their own pace. 

As we counterbalanced the voice of the target sentence (i.e. V-*te ageru* active versus V-*te morau* passive), the voice of the comprehension question (i.e. V-$\emptyset$ active versus V-(*r*)*are* passive), and the correct responses (i.e. whether 'yes' or 'no' was correct), one of eight lists of stimuli are presented following a Latin-square design (See Table \@ref(tab:SPR-CQ-stimuli) in \@ref(sec:stimuli)). 

### Data analysis

#### Data exclusion criteria

Since 55 participants participated or were suspected of participating in the experiment multiple times, their data were removed from our analyses. The data from 50 participants were also removed as the stimuli were not properly presented or were suspected of not being properly presented to them. Data from 2 participants were removed due to recording errors on the server. Data from 2 participants with overall accuracy for distractors is \<75% were removed from the final analysis, following @Paolazzi_etal2019. Ultimately, the data from 145 participants were eventually analysed.

In PCIbex, a trial proceeds to the last region with little or no reading in the middle, if the space key is held down during a trial instead of pressing it each time a region is read. In such a case, the reading time of each region tends to be recorded as around 35 ms. Therefore, the reading times less than 50 ms were also excluded.


#### Statistical models

We fit Bayesian generalised mixed effect models with by-participants and by-items correlated varying intercept and varying slopes using `R` [@R-base]. We used `brms` package [@R-brms] for the model building, with the backend of `cmdstanr` [@R-cmdstanr] for the coefficient calculation, and with the backend of `rstan` [@R-rstan] to pass `stanfit` objects to `bridgesampling` [@R-bridgesampling] for the Bayes factor calculation. We fit every model using `brms::brm()` with 4 chains and 4 cores in parallel,  2000 warm-up and 50000 post-warm-up iterations, and a target mean acceptance probability $\delta = 0.9$ for the NUTS sampler. 

We calculated the Bayes factors for the alternative over the null model ($\text{BF}_{10}$) to test whether each explanatory variable had a non-null effect on the response variables. For instance, to test the presence of voice effect (i.e. difference in reading time or accuracy between V-*te morau* versus V-*te ageru*), we compared an alternative model with the coefficient (parameter) of voice effect against a null model without that coefficient, by calculating a $\text{BF}_{10}$. The $\text{BF}_{10}$ for voice effect larger than one indicates that the difference in voice affects the reading time or accuracy. On the other hand, the $\text{BF}_{10}$ less than one means that there is no effect of voice on the reading time or accuracy. Lee and Wagenmakers' criteria [-@BCM2013, derived from Jeffreys,]  was used to determine the strength of the evidence for alternative models or null models:

```{=latex}

        Moderate evidence



```{=latex}
%\renewcommand{\labelitemii}{}
\renewcommand{\labelitemii}{\normalfont\bfseries \textendash}
```

Since the priors of both the explanatory variables and intercept may radically affect the computation of Bayes factors [See Section 15.3 of @PL-BDA2021], we calibrated those priors using prior predictive checks following @Schad_etal2020 and @Schad_etal2022. To track changes in the values of coefficient and $\text{BF}_{10}$ depending on priors, we calculated $\text{BF}_{10}$ multiple times for each explanatory variable using normally-distributed priors with a mean of zero, but with different SDs, adapting the procedure of @Nicenboim_etal2020.

##### Reading time data {#sec:cq-reading-time}

Reading time was assumed to be log-normally distributed. The explanatory variables of interest, namely voice of the target, was sum-coded, with V-*te morau* benefactive passive coded as $1$ and V-*te ageru* benefactive passive coded as $-1$. The number of characters in the region and the absolute trial order were also added to the models as covariates. The absolute trial order is the order in which one target is presented among all stimuli including distractors. Both the number of characters in the region and the trial order are $z$-transformed, following @PL-BDA2021 [Section 9.2]. Since the number of characters differed by condition of voice (i.e. the between-item factor), there was no random slope of items for the factor.

According to prior predictive checks, we used normally-distributed priors for target voice with varying SD of 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.075, 0.05, 0.025, 0.01, 0.0075, 0.005, 0.0025, and 0.001. For other parameters, we used the priors summarised in Table \@ref(tab:priors-reading-time).

```
##### Accuracy of comprehension questions

We fit mixed effects logistic regressions to the accuracy data. The voice of the target was sum-coded, with V-*te morau* benefactive passive coded as $-1$ and V-*te ageru* benefactive passive coded as $1$. The NP order in comprehension questions was also sum-coded, with NP1 $\to$ NP2 (the same as the target) coded as $1$ and NP2 $\to$ NP1 (reversed from the target) coded as $-1$. The voice (mis)match effect was coded using a nested sum contrast [@Schad_etal2020_contrasts], so that 1 is assigned if voice matches between target and question, as summarised in Table \@ref(tab:nested-sum-contrast). The $z$-transformed absolute trial order was also added to the models as a covariate.

According to prior predictive checks, we used normally-distributed priors for target voice with varying SD of 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, and 0.05. We used $\text{N}(1.3, 0.2)$ priors for intercepts, $\text{N}(0, 0.1)$ priors for the slopes, and LKJ priors with $\eta = 2$ for the correlation matrices.

## Predictions

### Predictions for the reading time

As argued by @Paolazzi_etal2019 and @Paolazzi_etal2021_CL, the shorter reading times for passives than for actives were attributed to differences in the predictability of upcoming words/phrases based on antecedents between passives and actives. In Japanese, a dative *=ni* marked NP may signal that the sentence is passive, and an accusative *=o* marked NP may signal that the sentence is active. Thus, if parsers of native Japanese speakers are actively predicting the upcoming elements based on antecedents, reading time differences between conditions can occur in the verb (R5) and the modal immediately following the verb (R6), as shown in Table \@ref(tab:stimuli-1).

Meanwhile, a *=ni*~[dat]{.smallcaps}~-marked NP may not be sufficient to predict that a passive verb follows, and the facilitatory effect for passives may not occur. In this case, the reading time would be longer in V-*te morau* passives than in V-*te ageru* actives. Since both active voice and passive voice were analytically marked using auxiliary verbs in this experiment, the longer reading time for passives can be attributed more to the processing load needed to resolve the mapping of the thematic roles and grammatical functions (i.e. diathesis processing) than morphological inflection in the passive verb [as found by @Yokoyama_etal2006]. A spill-over and/or delay of the processing load encountered in the verb region (R5) may also occur, resulting in longer reading times in passives for verbs (R5), for modal particles immediately following verbs (R6), or for both regions.

### Predictions for the comprehension question tasks

@Paolazzi_etal2021_CL [Experiment 3] found that if both active and passive were used in the questions about thematic relations (i.e. who did something to whom), the difference in accuracy between actives and passives was neutralised, as the question and its target sentence matched by being in the passive voice and caused a facilitatory priming effect in favour of passive targets. Thus, a facilitatory effect caused by the voice match between the question and its target is also expected in Japanese.

## Results

### Reading time data {#reading-time-data}

As illustrated in Table \@ref(tab:tab-reading-time) (and Figure \@ref(fig:fig-ben-read-time-R1-R6) in \@ref(sec:reading-time-all-regions)), the median and mean reading time for V-*te morau* benefactive passive was longer than V-*te ageru* benefactive active in both verb (R5) and modal (R6) region. However, Bayes factors moderately favoured the alternative models and the presence of the effect of target voice only when the prior SDs were very constrained (i.e. $\text{SD} \leq 0.1$ for R5 and $\text{SD} \leq 0.025$ for R6) and thus yielded tiny estimates of the coefficient for the target voice, as demonstrated in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-R5-R6-table-fixef-voice). Furthermore, Bayes factors favoured the null models and the absence of the effect of the target voice when the prior SD was less constrained and thus yielded stable estimates of the coefficient for the target voice. This means that the voice contrast between V-*te morau* and V-*te ageru* had little impact on reading times.

### Accuracy of comprehension questions

As Figure \@ref(fig:fig-accuracy-facet-cq-NP-order) illustrates, accuracy was lower for V-*te morau* passive targets than V-*te ageru* active targets. This is supported by strong evidence of $\text{BF}_{10}$ as prior SD increases, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-accuracy-table-fixef). Accuracy was lower for comprehension question whose NP order was NP1 $\to$ NP2 than for those whose NP order was NP2 $\to$ NP1, supported by strong evidence of $\text{BF}_{10}$. Moreover, when comprehension questions had NP1 $\to$ NP2 order, matching the voice between target sentences and their comprehension questions drastically increased the accuracy, both in V-*te ageru* actives and V-*te morau* passives. These voice matching effects were corroborated by the extreme evidence of $\text{BF}_{10}$. However, such voice matching effects were not supported in either V-*te ageru* actives or V-*te morau* passives with low $\text{BF}_{10}$ when comprehension questions had a NP2 $\to$ NP1 order.
