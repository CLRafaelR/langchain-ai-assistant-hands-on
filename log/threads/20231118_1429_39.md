# ユーザープロンプト

As an esteemed psycholinguist, you have a track record of delivering exceptional papers and attracting significant audiences at conferences. Your presentations are designed to be accessible to students new to linguistics and those unfamiliar with psychological experiments, cognitive science, and Bayesian statistics, blending technical terms with plain language for clarity. Additionally, you structure your arguments to satisfy expert linguists, addressing intricate and highly specialised subjects.

In two weeks, you are scheduled to give a 20-minute presentation on your latest paper. You are preparing slides that will be rendered from Markdown, planning to dedicate about one minute to each slide, for a total of approximately 20 slides.

The following guidelines must be adhered to when composing your Markdown slides:

""""""

## Requirements

### Formats

1. Prefix each slide's title with `##`, followed by an empty line preceding the body text.
2. Ensure slide titles accurately encapsulate the essence of your paper's content.
3. Include a minimum of three and a maximum of five key points per slide to thoroughly yet succinctly convey the information.
4. Where necessary, provide two or three supplementary explanations for each key point to elucidate further. You have to update the explanation of a key point itself, rather than adding just one supplementary explanation to a key point, if you only come up with just one supplementary explanation. By following this, there must be two or three supplementary explanations per key point, where such supplementary explanations are required to clearly understand why and how much the key point is important to the psycholinguistic literature.

Example Markdown format for presentation slides:


```
## Introduction

- <Key Point 1>
  - <Supplementary Explanation 1.1>
  - <Supplementary Explanation 1.2>
- <Key Point 2>

6. For sections that are better elucidated with visuals, use a two-column format as demonstrated. The figures and tables that must be used are specified in the original paper in LaTeX code block:
7. Cite research using @mentions as per the original paper, for example, `[@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019]`.


### Contents

#### Based on the paper

The key points and supplementary explanations must be derived exclusively from the original paper's content. Refrain from incorporating unsolicited suggestions, personal interpretations, or speculative comments that are not present in the paper. Failure to authentically represent the paper's content will result in accusations of plagiarism and could permanently tarnish your academic publishing credentials. Ensure that your presentation strictly reflects the original paper.

#### State key points clearly and effectively use their supplementary expectations

For example, it is unacceptable to mention "challenge to the previous research" as a key point without supplementary explanation detailing how this research contrasts with prior studies. Instead, specify "challenge to the previous research on `<number>` points" and then clearly articulate these points through the corresponding number of supplementary explanations.
If you only come up with just one supplementary explanation, you have to rewrite the explanation of a key point itself, rather than adding just one supplementary explanation to a key point, to make the key point is more concrete than before.

#### Focus on the Main Topic

- Do not create an acknowledgements slide.
- Do not create an abbreviations or acronyms slide.

#### Explain the original paper in detail

In the following paper, Section `Definition of passive diathesis and voice and Japanese passive voices` (`\@ref(sec:def-passive-Japanese-passive)`) outlines the definition of 'passive' and how passive is expressed in Japanese using V-*te morau* and V-(*r*)*are* constructions. Explain the Japanese constructions understandably since number of participants who are unfamiliar with Japanese will attend to the conference, using three or four slides.

In European SVO languages, the cognitive load required for the processing of passives, as measured by reading times and accuracy to comprehension questions, was the same as or less than that for the active.   [@Paolazzi_etal2016; @Paolazzi_etal2017; @Paolazzi_etal2019 in English; @Grillo_etal2019 in German]. On the other hand, the results of experiments using Japanese V-(*r*)*are* passive suggest that passives can create a processing difficulty [@Tamaoka_etal2005; @Kinno_etal2008; @Tanaka_etal2017]. However, previous research on Japanese passives did not measure reading time, impeding direct cross-linguistic comparisons of reading time and comprehension accuracy. Moreover, these studies used a pair of constructions in which the passive verb chunk is not only syntactically but also morphologically more complex than the active verb chunk.


We conducted an experiment to compare reading times between V-*te morau* benefactive passive and its counterpart, V-*te ageru* benefactive active, controlling the morphological complexity. In this experiment, participants read sentences chunk by chunk at their own pace (i.e. a self-paced reading \[SPR\] task) targeting either of those two benefactive constructions, and then completed a comprehension question task using either the normal active V-$\emptyset$ or V-(*r*)*are* passive. 

No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that the reading time needed for V-*te morau* benefactive passives was different from the time needed for their counterpart V-*te ageru* benefactive actives. Nonetheless, accuracy in the comprehension question targeting V-*te morau* benefactive passives was drastically enhanced when the question itself used V-(*r*)*are* passive. This indicates the primability of patient-like beneficiaries and normal patients and implies that they may compose of a broad patientive macrorole.     

Section \@ref(sec:def-passive-Japanese-passive) outlines the definition of 'passive' and how passive is expressed in Japanese using V-*te morau* and V-(*r*)*are* constructions. Section \@ref(sec:passive-difficulty) reviews experimental results in English, German, and Japanese that measured processing difficulties in passives. Section \@ref(sec:periphrastic-passive-rationale) justifies the comparison of V-*te morau* passive and V-*te ageru* active, not V-(*r*)*are* passive and V-$\emptyset$ active. Section \@ref(sec:expt-benefactive-cq) reports the methodology and results of our SPR experiment. A discussion follows in Section \@ref(sec:discussion). 

# Definition of passive diathesis and voice and Japanese passive voices {#sec:def-passive-Japanese-passive}

In this article, the term 'diathesis' refers to the assignment of thematic roles to grammatical relations, and the term 'voice' refers to the verbal marking used to represent a certain diathesis, adopting Zúñiga and Kittilä's [-@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book] definition. According to these researchers, 'passive diathesis' the diathesis that maps a thematic patient role to a syntactic subject and demotes the agent role to an optional adjunct or oblique. 'Passive voice' is defined as a marker on a verb that indicates a passive diathesis. A marking style is synthetical if a morpheme is used to indicate passive; and it is analytical if passive is indicated by a construction that combines a non-finite form of a verb to convey the main lexical content and a functional auxiliary verb [@Zúñiga_Kittilä2019_book]. These definitions indicate that V-*te morau*  is an analytical passive construction. Moreover, these definitions distinguish passive constructions using V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau*, from other constructions that use the same forms. The following discussion introduces the passive voice using V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau* in the passive diathesis, which is the main focus of the current study. Whilst V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau* voice are employed in non-passive diathesis, they are beyond the scope of this study. Refer to \@ref(sec:sunucl) for further details on these usages.

The passive morpheme -(*r*)*are* following a main verb (*home*- 'to praise') synthetically marks the passive voice, as demonstrated in (@ref(v-rare)a). A patient (i.e. Mochizuki, the praisee of the praising event) is expressed by a nominative-marked subject and an agent (i.e. Kamimura, a praiser) by a dative-marked oblique. The agent is demoted from core argument status in the passive (@ref(v-rare)a), compared to in its active counterpart (@ref(v-rare)b), where the agent is a nominative-marked subject and a patient is an accusative-marked object.

      \glt `Kamimura praised Mochizuki.'
    }
  \end{xlist}
  \label{v-rare}
\end{exe}
```

V-*te morau*, as shown in (@ref(v-te-morau)a), is another passive construction according to the above definitions. A main verb in non-finite form with the converb *-te* and the auxiliary verb *morau*  compose a verbal chunk and analytically signal passive voice. Since the auxiliary verb *morau* originates from a receiving verb, V-*te morau* can be an example of what @Keenan_Dryer2007 [pp337--338] called a 'periphrastic passive' whose 'passive auxiliary is a verb of reception'.

V-*te morau* has its active counterpart V-*te ageru*, as shown in (@ref(v-te-morau)b). Active voice in V-*te ageru* is indicated by a main verb in non-finite form with the converb *-te* and the auxiliary verb *ageru*, which originates from a giving verb.

    | Kamimura=ga Mochizuki=o home-te age-ta.
    | K.=NOM M.=ACC praise-CVB BEN.ACT-PST
    | Kamimura praised Mochizuki.
:::

V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau* have similarities in the correspondences of semantic roles and grammatical function, especially when 1. the main verb denotes an event where one person acts on the other, such as praising and supporting events, and 2. the constructions only describe the event participants that are directly involved in that event (i.e. only agentive and patientive participants). In both constructions, the subject is assigned to the patient NP, which denotes an event participant who does not initiate the event [@Hayatsu2020_overview; @Hayatsu2020]. For instance, both addressers of (@ref(v-te-morau)a) and (@ref(v-rare)a) describe the event from the patient's perspective (i.e. not *who praised whom* but *who was praised by whom* in the event).  

Despite their similarity, V-(*r*)*are* and V-*te morau* also differ in several ways. The most evident difference is that only V-*te morau* expresses the assumptions of the addresser that 1. an event induced by the agent benefits the patient or undergoer denoted by a sentential subject and that 2. the referent owes the same benefit to the agent [@Takami_Kuno2002]. For instance, an addresser use (@ref(v-te-morau)a), not (@ref(v-rare)a), when the addresser assumes that the patient of an event (e.g. a praising event) receives some sort of benefit from the event. 

In typology, the beneficiary in benefactive constructions has been distinguished from patient, since beneficiaries are often coded differently from patients, especially using the oblique. Furthermore, the beneficiary is usually indirectly affected by the results of an event while the patient is directly affected [@Zúñiga_Kittilä2010]. However, in V-*te morau* constructions whose bivalent main verb denotes a human-to-human action, as shown in (@ref(v-te-morau)a), the beneficiary in the subject position is also a patient. The beneficiary in (@ref(v-te-morau)a), Mochizuki, is directly affected by the praising event, and is marked by nominative *=ga* in the same way as the patient in (@ref(v-rare)a).

## Typological Perspective on Benefactive Constructions

- Beneficiary vs. patient distinction
  - Beneficiaries often coded differently from patients
  - Beneficiaries indirectly affected, patients directly affected
- V-*te morau* and human-to-human actions
  - Beneficiary in subject position also a patient
  - Directly affected by the event and marked nominatively

## Discussion and Implications

- Review of passive processing in different languages
  - Comparison of cognitive load in European languages and Japanese
- Significance of V-*te morau* construction
  - Challenges the traditional beneficiary-patient distinction
- Broader implications for patientive macrorole
  - Potential overlap between patient-like beneficiaries and normal patients
