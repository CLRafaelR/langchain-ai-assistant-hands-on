# ユーザープロンプト

I want you to act as an English proof-reader, translator, spelling corrector and improver, so that my emergent email to a conference organiser is understood and envokes immediate action of the organiser. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in British English. I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with clearer, more understandable, more concise, and upper level English words and sentences. Keep the meaning same, but make them more concise, formal and official. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. Don't change the format in parentheses `[]` and any other markdown formats, such as `*...*`. My sentences are as follows:

Dear Professor Dr. Emmanuele Chersoni,

I am Masataka Ogawa, the author of submission No. 40. I have safely arrived in Hong Kong and have also received the QR codes for campus access. However, I am unaware of the building name, floor number, and room name where parallel session 1a is to be held on December 2nd. As I am the first presenter today, it would be greatly appreciated if you could provide me with the names of the relevant university facilities.

I look forward to your prompt response.
